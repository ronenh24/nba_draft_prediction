Karl-Anthony Towns,1,"Center prospect with the size and skill set to make a strong impact at both ends of the floor in the NBA … Hard worker, smart kid, with strength of character … Shows desire and a competitive nature … Possesses a great feel for the game … Offensive game oozes potential with a text book shooting form, great touch and ability to hit outside and mid range jumpers effortlessly and consistently … Has even implemented a steadily improving hook shot into his repertoire … His length and strong body gives him excellent ability to rebound and hold position in the post … Tremendous rebounder on a per 40 minute basis, with big hands, good box out fundamentals, post positioning and energy … Has worked hard on his body and has developed broad shoulders and good strength … Should be able to add additional weight and play comfortably in the 260-270 range … Shows a willingness to play physical and fight in the post … Terrific passer, good vision, he’s able to find players when doubled, and even have the offense run through him at the high post … Very good shot blocker. Though not a huge leaper, has excellent timing and shows the ability to use his great length as a rim protector … Shows better speed than quickness, and can really motor once he gets a head of steam … Hustles and shows the willingness to defend and play hard … Underrated foot speed and perimeter defensive ability … Doesn’t seem to get winded easily, though the UK platoon system helps in this area … Has shown the ability to defend players much smaller than himself with success on the perimeter …","Has struggled mightily with his post offense early in the season. Post play, foot work and confidence on the block needs a lot of work … Still appears to be growing into his body, movements are gangly … A very solid athlete, but not the most explosive leaper without momentum, though he’s shown the ability to dunk from the free throw line, so he’s not exactly a plodder … Second jump leaping not a strong point … Appears to leap better off of one foot than two which is better for wing players … Huge feet seem to weigh him down some and challenge his ability to make quick moves from a standstill position … Has shown a tendency to get in foul trouble and the current ""platoon system"" at Kentucky does not allow scouts to accurately judge his ability to play full games and stay out of foul trouble … Has a lot less pressure to produce on a daily basis on a stacked UK team. It’s easy to look good when teams are not able to focus all of their attention on a player the caliber of Towns. Coach Calipari’s system also does an excellent job of showcasing a player’s strengths while masking their weaknesses … Top heavy. Despite showing a huge set of arms and shoulders, his lower body strength needs work, as he gets knocked off balance and pushed around at times. Balance can improve. Granted, considering his age and work ethic, these are not hugely concerning issues …",84,250,19.62
D'Angelo Russell,2,"Precocious point guard with tremendous ball skills … Intriguing long term prospect considering his package of attributes … Smart, and smooth guard who never seems to get rattled or rushed into making mistakes … Shows great poise and maturity for a freshman. Makes everything look easy … Great imagination and creativity. His vision and passing ability is very intriguing … Excellent decision maker and appears to have the ability to develop into a point guard for the next level … His drive and dish already is an effective element to his game … 6-foot-9 wingspan gives him the ability to disrupt passing lanes and shots, as well as giving him extra length to get to loose balls and get shots off … Shows good form on his shot and a quick release. Connecting at a good rate on shots at all 3 levels through the early part of the season … Very good at running the pick-and-roll, well ahead of most guards at the same stage in that element … Very good at creating shots in the midrange with a nasty handle, using crossovers and fakes to rock defenders off balance … Conditioning and confidence in his first year have both been impressive … Has worked on his body and is showing better upper body strength …","Still unproven as point guard, so the question is how long it will take him to become effective and productive on the NBA level at the lead guard position … Not a bigtime athlete. His length helps him to defend but he’s a below average run/jump athlete by NBA standards … Needs to develop a better intensity level at the defensive end … Shot is good, although he may need to tweak his release slightly, in order to extend his range out to NBA 3. He tends to turn into his shot slightly, and should work on ironing out his form … Also needs to sustain a level of consistency through an entire college season … Has trouble finishing in transition, change of speed and added strength (particularly his legs) would help this tremendously, lack of explosiveness has hurt his efficiency in this area … Like most young guards, can use some work on his off hand and shot selection … Decision making is good, but a bit turnover prone at this stage …",76,195,19.35
Jahlil Okafor,3,"One of the most advanced low-post scorers the college game has seen in quite some time … Huge frame with strength that helps him establish post position on a regular basis … Gigantic, soft hands, looks like there is a volleyball in his hand at times … Post footwork is excellent for a player his size, very quick on his feet when he is close to the hoop … Feel for the game is excellent, tends to make his move as soon as he feels contact and can go over either shoulder, baseline or middle … Double teamed constantly, has a nice ability to dribble out of it without getting trapped and is a solid passer out of the low post … Legitimate center size, 6’11 with an approximate 7’5 wingspan, making him that much more difficult to stop, while making him at least a difficult presence to shoot over at the basket … Played 30.3 mpg, really seemed to work on his body and ran quite a bit better than he did in high school, his conditioning has not been as much of an issue as in the past … Very soft touch around the basket while getting quite a few shots, has shot an incredible 66.8% FG … While he is not an explosive leaper, his improved conditioning has given him more lift and really helped him run the floor and be part of the transition game … Difficult to keep off of the offensive glass, plus very dangerous when given second shot opportunities … Has potential to be a factor in the pick-and-roll, definitely someone difficult to stop when he has some momentum going to the basket … Very difficult to defend one-on-one, constantly draws attention from the defense down low, leading to a lot of open looks for perimeter players …  Draws a lot of fouls, had nearly 100 more fouls drawn than committed … Strength to go through contact … Has appeared to be quite coachable, plus while he does display intensity at times, never really seems to lose his cool","While his conditioning at Duke was a great sign, he is the type of player who will need to work on this constantly and can still tone his body to maximize his athletic potential … Lacks great lateral quickness and is not an explosive leaper … Could be much more of a presence as a defensive rebounder, will miss box outs and find himself out of position … While he shows a soft touch near the hoop, has struggled from the FT line for a majority of the year, only shooting 51.1% FT … Not a player that will stretch the floor, which some consider a downside as far as where the league is headed … Can struggle against length and athleticism, will have a much tougher time creating offense in the post … Struggled defending the pick-and-roll at times, will be that much more difficult in the NBA … Even if he did have a really high number of possessions used, his turnovers numbers were quite high, will be something to work on … His effort level has been under a microscope at times, some wonder whether he goes hard every possession … Lack of athleticism will hurt on defense, which might not make him the most ideal “franchise big man”, hard to name players who have had successful teams around them who have struggled defending the post … Foul trouble was not a major issue, but it might become more of one upon facing pro speed … Not a natural shot blocker, usually gets blocks with length alone and rarely leaves his feet, not an ideal rim protector … While he got fouled quite often, he really did not take as many FT’s as one would think, possible reluctance to get to the line? … Post skills are fantastic, though adding a nice bank shot or hook shot might be an area of focus to further diversify his offense",83,270,19.54
Kristaps Porzingis,4,"It’s not easy to find a legit 7-footer with great length and high level athleticism … If you consider how well he runs the floor and his skill level then you can understand why Porzingis is considered one of the most intriguing International players in recent years … A high level shooter, with a high release, very natural and quick with deep range … Ideal qualities to be a pick and pop stretch 4, however Porzingis is also pretty good shooting from off the bounce or coming off flair screens … His ability to put the ball on the floor in spot up situations is very underrated …  Unlikely that he will ever have the core and leg strength of Dirk, but the young Latvian has a lot of upside and if developed in the right way, and he could become a huge piece for many teams in today’s NBA where a stretch 4 can be a key element for spacing … Porzingis has great instincts to run in transition, and often outhustles opposing bigs for easy dunks … If he can improve his finishing ability, we are talking about a high level player capable creating his own shot from a number of areas … Defensively his size and wingspan make him a tough opponent to score over, he gives good rim protection, and he has good enough feet where he can show hard on pick and roll, or even switch and still create some problems for the ball handler … Once he gets more physical he can easily plug the ball screen … The bottom line is that Porzingis has every tool to make a really good contribution for whichever team that drafts him, and he can be an impact player for many years in the league …","The main issue for Pozingis is his strength, and while he has more physicality than some people might think, he will need to get much stronger to hold his own defensively in the post and actually build up on his offensive post game (that is currently not a strength) … He has a narrow frame with thin shoulders, sort of like Joakim Noah had, so adding good bulk and carrying it will be paramount … Right now he is not a good finisher at the rim, but with more upper body and lower body strength he could start to really take fully advantage of his skills … More than that I would like to see him make an improvement in his lower body strength, in order to finish those drives off close outs at the rim … His finishing ability needs to improve too. With his length, he should be able to finish left and right over people at the rim … The other consideration is regarding his rebounding ability, he struggles to get a high number of rebounds and this leads many people to consider him the new Bargnani … I doubt that he will be as good as a shooter as some are suggesting, because he is not a high volume shooter, but … Porzingis has the athleticism and motor to do better than the 4 rebounds per game he averaged this year … Another weakness is fitting a position. He is obviously a 4 offensively but defensively he needs to be in a system where he will not get exposed for his lack of strength and rebounding, but he will actually shine as a rim protector … Porzingis has the upside to become a key player in the league, but his development is going to be huge for him to not be remembered as just another European who can only shoot …",85,230,19.91
Mario Hezonja,5,"Standing 6-8, he has ideal size for the wing position … Has a solid structure and high level athleticism even by NBA standards … He has bulked up some, adding muscle to his frame over the last couple seasons, training with top level athletes in a competitive environment … He combines good size with amazing body control, athleticism and leaping abilities, showing a quick first step and explosiveness … Offensively he’s a solid shooter, with an improved shooting form, a quick release and unlimited range, even far away behind the three point line … His offensive repertoire includes spot up shots from the corners, pull-up jumpers or finishing by attacking the rim, where he’s able to fully utilize his athleticism … He’s an underrated passer whowing the ability to find teamates with solid court vision and basketball IQ … He has improved his off the ball game, displaying the ability to find the proper spot and timing … Defensively, he’s able to guard basically two positions (2 and 3) in Europe (and probably in US) combining his speed, size and quick hands … He shows ttremendous instincts in jumping passing lanes … Thanks to his size, he’s also an above the average rebounder for the wing… He’s really confident on his talent, he’s really comfortable in clutch situations …","He still could work on his body strength to better withstand contact in the NBA … He lacks a solid mid-range game, which is the area where he struggles the most … He’s effective in ISO situations, but he tends to need a screen or generally a situation that creates an advantage for him, since when he’s forced to create a basket from off the dribble, he is less effective than other elite prospects … Despite his improved shot selection, he still tends to look for his shot instead of finding an open man when the defense is good, even though he has solid passing skills … His off the ball defense is not effective enough, since he lacks focus and positioning, furthermore he tends to be too aggressive in the closeouts leading to useless fouls … This could be considered his breakout season concerning his performances, but the consistency is still a sticky point, especially from one game to the next … He has worked a lot on his temper, but his fiery nature and cocky attitude is still his trademark, and can get him in trouble at times …",80,215,20.34
Willie Cauley-Stein,6,"Cauley-Stein is a player who is both extremely gifted from a measurements standpoint, but also in terms of athleticism … At the Kentucky Combine he measured 7’.25’’ in shoes, with a 7’2’’ wingspan, and a great 9’2’’ standing reach … He also is extremely nimble, and an explosive and quick leaper … Willie also has tremendous defensive abilities, excelling at hedging on pick and rolls, as well as protecting the rim … He’s seen a dip in shot blocking numbers due to his use as a pick and roll defender, and  Karl Anthony Towns being used as the primary paint enforcer, but as a sophomore WCS blocked 2.9 shots per game as Kentucky’s primary rim protector … His physical tools should allow these elite defensive traits to translate to the NBA level … Cauley-Stein has the potential to be able to guard NBA wing positions at a high level, at least early in his NBA career … He is also a strong finisher around the rim, and an ideal roll target in the NBA. His junior season at Kentucky he shot 72.5% at the rim, and he’s an active player on the offensive glass which helped him rack up 40 put backs in 38 games … He had a number of highlight plays in which he went over and through defenders for highlight finishes at the rim … Although not a major offensive threat, he has improved his free throw shooting every season starting from an anemic .372% as a freshman, to a significantly better .617% as a junior (granted 61% remains below average) … This work has also shown up in his ability to knock down short jump shots in the half court game … He also has a decent jump hook which could potentially be honed over time … Cauley-Stein is also very productive in his time on the court … Due to UK’s depth he played just 25.8 minutes per game, but his per 40 minute averages are 14.1 ppg 10 rpg 2.6 bpg and 1.8 spg …","Willie is very much a defensive oriented player, and a guy who really doesn’t project into much of an offensive contributor  … His work at the free throw line has shown some promise, but he projects mostly as a lob finisher, roll target, and garbage man in an NBA offense … His touch and shooting are a real weakness in terms of game speed … He’s also had some ups and downs over his career in terms of focus … For a player with such immense phyical gifts, it’s baffling that he wasn’t a more productive player early in his college career … Feel for the game is a major question mark … WCS has exhibited more poise, and fire as a junior, but he still has shown times in which he’s seemed a little passive or not 100% into the game … WCS has the feel of an athlete who is becoming a basketball player, and while the intrigue with his defensive abilities is apparent, he remains a project for the NBA level … Continued improvement and growth in terms of focus will be needed in order to play a long 82 game NBA season …",84,242,21.87
Emmanuel Mudiay,7,"Rare combination of size, speed, agility and athleticism to go with the vision and mentality of a point guard … Has great intangibles with natural leadership and communication skills … Also an extremely competitive kid who rises in big situations and has a killer instinct … Very quick first step and adept ball skills that really help him when attacking the basket … Showed in China he was adept at absorbing contact and still finishing the play … Has added strength and was not overwhelmed by the pro game physically … Really difficult cover in transition, great at pushing the ball on the break with explosive ability to finish while also being an adept passer on the run … While he possesses great quickness at 6’5, he’s also quite good at using change of speed and direction … Good passer, has run the point throughout his life and is a creative passer who is good at finding his teammates in scoring position … Very good at creating for himself, getting to spots where he can get good looks at the basket … Understands the pick-and-roll quite well, should thrive as he learns to run it against NBA competition … Really good with the in-out dribble, particularly with his strong right hand … Has shown real ability to finish at the basket with either hand … With his size and strength, can post-up, and punish smaller guards … Great feel for the game … Shooting mechanics and balance seem to be improving since his time in the pros … Length and lateral quickness could make him a strong defender in time, definitely seems willing to put in work as a defender … Very strong rebounder for a guard, good nose for the ball and covers a lot of ground … While he does at times force the issue, China showed that he is leaning more on his strengths and has a greater knowledge of what he does best … Averaged 31.5 mpg and seems to be a candidate to get well accustomed to NBA level conditioning … At only 19-years of age, already has a great knowledge of the game, seems to be quite willing to learn and has ability to fill out his solid physique even more so … Showed a level of perseverance by staying in China to recuperate from his ankle injury to play in Guangdong’s last two games, when some just believed he would head home and prepare for the draft … Competitor, consistently gives a strong effort and shows a great deal of confidence in his ability …","Has struggled with his midrange and outside shooting, often off balance or struggles with timing to release the ball at the highest point of his jump … In a small sample size (13-38 3PT, 27-47 FT), only shot 34.2% from 3-point range and 57.4% from the FT stripe and will need to work on improving those numbers to keep defenses honest … Will settle for bad shots, plus will sometimes be unnecessarily off balanced on good looks … Must improve his confidence and consistency as a shooter … Still has a tendency to depend on the dribble too much, be careless with the ball and go for the highlight rather than settling for a more calculated decision … Had 5.9 apg: 3.25 topg, and while a 1.82 assist-to-turnover ratio is not terrible for a player his age, he definitely needs to cut down his turnovers to be an effective NBA PG … Sometimes has lapses when he is off the ball on defense, plus needs to be more consistent in getting low in his stance … Some of his worst games were against the more established Pro/NBA players, so will still likely need some work before being completely ready to help a team win consistently … Can be even more effective if he worked on his skills off of the ball, where he could be a strong cutter in time … His decision to play overseas in China makes him much more of a mystery to NBA teams, and also decreased his development over the past year … Suffered a severe ankle sprain while in China, seems to have recuperated fully, will just need to monitor this and look at future injury prevention … Seeing that he is the first high level US player to go directly to the Chinese Basketball Association, it is really difficult to tell what his numbers mean in relation to the top NCAA and even European prospects who have more of a sample size, could possibly affect where he goes in the draft … For a player who attacks and gets to the basket as often as he did, did not get to the line at a great rate, which will be something that will be crucial to his success in the NBA …",77,200,19.32
Stanley Johnson,8,"Versatile and two-way wing player with considerable upside (turns 19 on May 29th) … Solid feel for the game … Ultimate competitor and does the little things it takes to win … Athletically gifted with a strong body frame … Great physical attributes and nice size … 6-11 ½ wingspan … Both upper and lower body are rock solid … Combines speed, quickness, power at a high level … Has great footwork … Can score the ball in numerous ways (still polishing his offensive game) … Good change of pace player … Slasher … Shooting stroke has shown improvement … Jump shot has balance and elevation … Capable of hitting jump shots off the dribble and by pulling or spotting up … Can knock down spot up 3-pointers (has a quick release and always keeps hands and feet set) … Has range on his shot … Possesses a floater (has a nice touch) … A freight train in transition when he’s running with a head of steam … He’s best in transition, where his natural athleticism allows him to flourish (takes long strides) … Fills the lane correctly when he needs to … Ball-handling abilities are good for someone his size … Handles the ball well on the fast break and in pick and rolls … Good with splitting defenders and knowing when to pull up in pick and roll situations … Effective when going underneath screens on the pick and roll … Able to create his own scoring opportunities off the dribble … Has shown that he can pass the ball when he’s under control and taking his time … Relentless when driving the ball … Bullies his way to the basket with his strength and keeps defenders on his hip … Smaller guards are no match when he takes them off the dribble … Able to finish at the rim or draw fouls through contact … Has a strong first step, can quickly change directions and turn the corner … Strong driver and finisher in transition and halfcourt … Attacks closeouts really well with his power and quickness … When facing up, he’s able to attack from mid-range spots … Comfortbale and knows how to operate on the block against smaller big men … Does a good job moving without the ball … Rebounds the ball extremely well for a wing … Crashes the offensive boards with great aggression and timing … Can rebound in traffic, never stops, outworks others … Is not afraid to mix it up in the paint … Can guard multiple positions (spots 1-4) … Excellent on ball defender (can lockdown when focused) … Uses his huge chest to muscle any offensive threat … Puts pressure on the ball and has a good stance … Keeps his (big) hands high and active … Able to cover ground quickly on closeouts and can recover if he gets beat … Moves and chops his feet well … Capable of guarding smaller bigs … Uses his length to deny passes and contest shots … Can block shots using his athleticism … Gives great effort when chasing and denying shooters off screens … Good anticipation when playing the passing lanes (1.5 steals per game) … Strength allows him to hold his own when he’s defending on the low block … Plays tough and physical defense … Has a high motor when’s locked in and doesn’t give up … Got to the free throw at a nice rate (average FT shooter) … Confident player who doesnt shy away from taking over a game or being the go-to player … Tremendous will power. Transformed himself from a 6-5 PF as a HS frehsman into a legit wing player with the ability to create for himself and others off the dribble at the wing position …","A little inconsistent on both ends of the floor this past season … Needs to improve his ability to directly finish as the rim … Better leaper off of two feet than one. Not incredibly explosive, just solid leaping ability … Has nice touch overall, but not against length … Doesn’t go up as strong versus longer players … Does not finish as well against contact as his strength may make you think … Is often out of control when driving to the rim … Sometimes settles for floaters too often … Needs to prove he can make his teammates better … Struggles with making decisions (setting up teammates) when he’s attacking the basket in transition … Sometimes has tunnel vision when he’s on the move on offense and does not look to pass to his teammates … Missed a lot of open teammates … Not an accurate passer … Needs to develop his left hand more (finishing and ball-handling) … Often relies too much on overpowering and going through defenders on the dribble drive … Forgets about his teammates at times because he tries to prove himself as a scorer … Play more below the rim in half court settings … Struggles at times to create for himself against quick defenders … Fails to create separation in isolation situations … Gets too caught up in creating contact that it takes his focus off getting to the rim and finishing … This also gets him called for a lot of charges … Struggled with shot selection … Tends to push the ball even when there’s no numbers … Needs to pick his spots better … Forces bad shots in the paint against multiple defenders … Short arms his shots … Streaky shooter … Needs to develop a more consistent jumper from mid-range and the 3-point line … Jump shot has a flat/low release … Shoots contested jumpers early in the clock … A little turnover prone … Effort level on defense fluctuates at times … Needs to be consistently locked in on defense instead of just in flashes (has lapses) … Although he can recover well, he gets beat off the dribble from the perimeter … Either loses his man or overhelps … Gets caught ball watching … Slow in his recognition of screens at times … Lets his aggressiveness get the best of him … Good rebounder but sometimes fails to put his body on a man and box out …",78,242,19.08
Frank Kaminsky,9,"At 7-feet, there not many players around with his offensive skill set …. Highly fundamental, Kaminsky has great footwork, can go left and right and does a great job of using his length on offense … He can finish at the rim with either hand, post up on either block, shoot from the mid-range, consistently knock down 3’s and even attack you from off the dribble … The lack of quickness and explosiveness is compensated by his high basketball IQ … He is able to go by defenders on close outs, controlling his body to avoid charges, but also to basically post up from 16/15 feet and slowly back down defenders to the basket … His shooting touch is what is really intriguing about him … He didn’t shoot particularly well in the summer camps (adidas Nations) but he has been very consistent during this first part of the season, so far, even from long range, though he needs to get his feet set to be effective … He is a scoring threat from everywhere on the court … He loves utilizing his spin move, going back to the middle of the floor, and knows how to use it to be aggressive and shoot over his defender in a similar way of what Dirk does at the NBA level … Perhaps an area where he is a little underrated is passing, he has great vision of the court and makes really good decision with the ball, at his height he can see the floor really well and that can help in high-low situations, for example … A perfect guy to play pick and pop, very hard to ICE on ball screens, he spaces the floor well and he is also effective in the post … In the NBA, he will have to be a 4 offensively, and life will not be as easy to get by opponents, he will need to be a professor and learn all thr tricks with angles and fakes in order to not be neutralized by his lack of athleticism … Despite that he is 7-foot and able to contest shots in the paint, the long arms help him get many rebounds, but he will have to add strength to hold off NBA players while boxing them out …  20 years ago his size would probably have made him more appealing, in today quick, athletic game he will have to find the right system in order to show all of his skills offensively … He also possesses a high character with a lot of personality and confidence …","The most obvious one is his subpar level of athleticism and lateral movement, but one of the main concerns with him ironically is on offense … It’s possible to find a role for him defensively where he won’t be exploited, he has length after all,  but will he be able to succeed in an offensive system different from the one he thrives in at Wisconsin? The fact that he struggled so mightily in the wide open format in front of so many scouts at adidas Nations in the summer has to be a conern … Theoretically he is the perfect guy to play in the triangle offense,  in a way that maybe only Pau Gasol did, and certainly he could find his place an offense like the Spurs (every high IQ player could) … But could he survive in more ISO oriented offenses where he will not have the ball in his hands much? A lot will depend on his consistency shooting, the percentages show us he is improving but the NBA 3 pointer is a different animal and though the high release will help Kaminsky a lot in shooting over people, his release is pretty slow and could be a problem … The talent is there but he has to show he can use it at the next level, and his limited upside (because he is already almost at the top of his game) and older age might scare some team away (Tyler Zeller was a much better/faster athlete and he fell to 20 as a senior, and has been traded)… Another big question mark is how will he deal with NBA physicality on both ends of the floor … He could potentially guard 5s but only if he adds strength to his body, while the 4 position could be too fast and explosive for him … And on offense people may push him out of the blocks too easily … The fact that he didn;t really do anything in his first two seasons in college is also a slight concern. Is he just a late bloomer, or is he taking advantage of players younger than himself as an upperclassman? … All that being said, we are talking about a player with a rare set of skills, who in the right system could utilize his abilities and become a great role player …",85,230,22.24
Justise Winslow,10,"Big time athlete with elite level speed and athleticism … Shows the ability to score in a variety of ways, with spot up shooting as well as scoring off the dribble … Can finish at the rim with highlight dunks, and does a good job of utilizing his great body strength to absorb contact … Very dangerous in the open floor with his speed and leaping ability … Tremendous basketball body with solid wingspan and great body strength considering his age … One of those rare kids that had an NBA ready body coming out of high school … Lefty shooter with nice touch … Has knocked down the college 3 ball at a good clip and with steady volume (39% with 1.4 makes per game) … Excellent on ball defender showing great lateral speed and awareness as well as a high effort level. Even blocks some shots, making use of his great quickness and timing … Has done a solid job of avoiding turnovers and making solid decisions with the ball, as evidenced by his positive a/to ratio … Comfortable handling the ball on the break … Has exhibited a nice ability to create off the dribble from the perimeter and get to the rim and finish … Also has good body control and touch on the move. His ability to convert plays while operating at such a high rate of speed is very intriguing … Smart kid and considered a high character individual …","Throughout his high school and AAU career he flashed tremendous talent but struggled to sustain a high level of consistency … Can lose focus at times during games, but has been a lot more consistent and prepared then expected … He needs to continue to show a high level of aggression and intensity in order to realize his immense talent … Shot shows high potential but still has some minor kinks in his mechanics that need to be ironed out in order to add range and consistency … Should look to improve upon his current 62% FT shooting …",78,222,19.26
Myles Turner,11,"The thing that jumps out the most is his exceptional length and frame … Measuring 6’11.5"" tall in shoes, and sporting a 7’4""; wingspan gives him elite size as an NBA power forward … While still a lean player, he wears his 243 pounds well, and has room to add weight and play at over 250 pounds without much or any projected loss in mobility or athleticism … Turner also has great hands, and a face up game giving him immense potential in the pick and roll and pick and pop heavy NBA landscape … Myles most certainly has an NBA position, and 13 games into his NCAA career, he’s really showcasing the type of shooter he is … Turner is shooting 40% from 3 point range, 44.4% on two point jumpers, and his model of efficiency translates down low as well where the young big is shooting 69.7% at the rim … It’s not often you see a guy pushing 7-feet among the conference leaders in free throw percentage, but Myles 89% clip ranks him 2nd in the Big 12, and 30th in the NCAA … Young for his class, Myles’ accomplishments and polish at just 18 years of age make him a very enticing prospect … He’s shown a great deal of creativity on the block … He’s already executing step backs jumpers, fadeaways, and shown a great feel for the offensive game very early into his collegiate career … With continued growth and polish he has the potential to be among the best shooting big men and stretch 4’s in the game … Defensively he’s no slouch either. In only 21 minutes per game, he’s leading the Big 12 in blocked shots (2.7 per game) and has emerged as a terror on the help side. He shows excellent timing and instincts to block shots, and gets off the ground quickly despite his lack of great fluidity … Also, with a reported 9’1.5"" standing reach, he has the length to contest shots 1 on 1 at the NCAA and NBA level, and while his current weight isn’t conducive to pushing around NBA big men, 240 pounds is considerably larger than many young forwards have come into the league at since the 1 and done rule was implemented … Turner even shows surprising passing and decision making with a 1:1 a/to ratio, unusual for a freshman big … Scores very highly in the character and communication department. Seems wise beyond his years and should have no trouble adapting to the NBA game and staying focused …","Lacks fluidity, certainly he’s a guy who is mobile and can run the court, but his athleticism isn’t something that jumps out when you watch him … He has had some difficulties with his hips related to growth. His legs appear to be extremely stiff to the point where it appears he runs with a slight limp. Time will tell whether this is a temporary thing or he will always be a player lacking fluidity … Since he is so young, he could be one of those players who could improve his athletic ability, and flexibility with continued weight training … His lower body strength is probably of the most concern right now, as he can be pushed off the block and out of position by older, more physical NCAA players … While he’s definitely held his own in some bigger games this year, when matched against players his own size or larger from a bulk standpoint, he’s yet to really excel.

LeBryan Nash,-1,"Le’Bryan’s size and ability to defend are his biggest selling points when looking towards the NBA. Standing 6’6.5’’ barefoot, possessing a 6’10’’ wingspan, 8’6’’ standing reach, and weighing in at a powerful 232 pounds, Nash has really solid measurements for an NBA small forward … He’s proved to be a solid, and physical defender at the NCAA level, and his physical traits and athleticism project him to be a player capable of guarding the small forward spot at the next level … Not a player that really stuffs the stats on the defensive end, his role with the Cowboys was to defend their opponents most prolific wing, something Le’Bryan did with great success … Offensively, Nash has a great first step, and has really developed into a polished slasher at the college level … He not only has the speed to get past defenders, but the hops and strength to dunk over, and finish through contact … Nash made 7.1 trips to the line per contest last season, and he hit 79% of those shots, very good marks … His offensive game is limited within the 3 point arc, but he’s a 40.6% jump shooter on 2 point field goals, and his a good shooter off the dribble out to about 18 feet … He knows his game, and as a first time 1st option as a senior, scored at a high level (17.2 ppg) and hit double figures in every game this season … He uses his strength on the glass as well, and is an above average rebounder for his position (5.7 rpg, and 7.2 per 40 minutes).","Le’Bryan’s jump shot is by no means busted, but he simply does not have 3 point range … Despite a surprising long range showing in the Portsmouth Invitational, he still doesn’t have a large enough sample size to sell himself as an improved 3 point shooter … He was just 2-20 during his senior season, and didn’t make a single 3 pointer as a junior … Merely getting his long range game up to the level where he can hit an open corner 3 would do wonders for his NBA outlook … Nash’s physicality on defense is one of his selling points, but he fouls at a pretty high rate for a wing player. And he gained a reputation while in high school as a player that was averse to contact …. Adapting to the speed of the NBA game, while not giving up easy fouls will be key in his translation, but I’m confident this is a weakness Le’Bryan can improve upon with gained experience … As a senior, his TO rate was a little high (3.2 per game), but as a junior when he was a 3rd option, he played well in a less featured role and only gave up the ball 1.9 times per contest … Hopefully in an NBA system where he’s more of a cog in the machine rather than a featured offensive player, his turnover rate will settle down to the numbers he posted as a junior when he wasn’t a number 1 offensive option … Probably pretty close to the player he’ll end up being, Nash has room for improvement, but not a particularly high ceiling at his age …",80,232,23.0

After playing his first 3 seasons at Houston, he also transitioned well into a complimentary role at OU, and this adaptability and knowledge of his game bodes well for a transition to an NBA role player … He’s also improved significantly from the free throw line since his freshman year. He raised his FT clip from 53% to 69% during his stint in college, and despite a slight dip in his percentage of 2 point jumpers (33.8%, according to data from hoop-math.com) as a Senior, his clip over his first 3 years was right around 40%, and TaShawn has face up and pick-and-pop potential in the NBA. He’s also a pretty solid post passer, and tallied 4 games of 4 or more assists last year as a Sooner … Thomas’ long arms, and good timing make him a surprisingly adequate shot blocker. A 9’ standing reach paired with his instinct, he blocked 262 shots during his 4 year NCAA career.","TaShawn’s biggest weakness is probably the fact that he’s just 6’8’’ in shoes and lacks the ball handling skills, 3 point range, and athletic ability to play the small forward spot … His length dimensions are really pretty solid, which helps make up for this, but his lack of high caliber leaping ability and quickness doesn’t do him any favors … His 3/4 court sprint, and agility drill were both in the bottom 10 of this year’s NBA combine participants … Lacks great speed and explosiveness … He’s definitely used to using his bulk to his advantage, but in the NBA where the game pace is faster, plus the games and seasons are longer, he’ll need to trim down the 12.4% body fat he measured in Chicago … He seems to be working on this as he measured in 4 pounds lighter at the combine than he did in April’s Portsmouth Invitational Tournament.",80,240,22.34

Trevor Lacey,-1,"Lacey is a proven scorer at the college level.  He is a strong combo guard with a knack for putting points on the board.  He’s a knockdown shooter from any spot on the floor but is at his best when the floor is spaced and he has room to take his man one on one.  Doesn’t need much room to get his shot off and is deadly when doing so.  He is extremely crafty with his dribble which allows him to get by defenders without elite quickness.  He’s good at using his strength and deceptive handles to create space.  Great pick and roll player as he’s got decent vision and a great jump shot from mid-range as well as from distance.  While not elite in terms of athleticism, he is a sneaky athlete and will surprise you.  He’s a decent rebounder and isn’t afraid to attack the rim when given the opportunity against lesser defenders.  Finishes well in traffic due to his strength and ability to absorb contact.  He really showed great leadership for the Wolfpack during his junior season as he was the ""go-to"" player and never shied away from taking the last shot.  Extremely confident in his abilities.","Lacey is the epitome of a combo guard that really doesn’t have a set position at the next level.  He does most of his damage in ISO situations and isn’t great at creating for his teammates which limits his potential as a PG.  As a SG, he lacks the ideal length and athleticism needed at the NBA level.  While he’s got some handles, he isn’t what scouts would call a great ball handler.  On the defensive end he leaves a lot to be desired.  He’s got the tools to be an effective defender and his extremely strong but often times he seemed more inclined to save his energy for the offensive end.  Gets beat off the dribble too much for the next level.  He’s also 24 years old which is ancient for a draft prospect.",75,210,23.72

LaDontae Henton,-1,"At 6-foot-6, 215, Henton is a tough and physical forward … Routinely uses his strength and athleticism as an advantage when fighting for position with bigger players to secure rebounds or score in the paint…NBA body … Plays bigger than his actual size … Has a knack for being where the ball is, especially when it comes to rebounding and coming up with loose balls … Has good anticipation and is quick to go after offensive rebounds … Does not shy away from physicality (willing to take charges and bang with bigger players) … Can defend more than one position with his size and length … Aggressive rebounder and offensive player … A pure scorer with a versatile and smooth offensive game … Is always a threat to score whether he’s in the post, in transition, or pulling up from mid-range or deep … Great catch-and-shooter … Uses an array of ball fakes to create space and knock down either one-dribble or two-dribble pull-ups … Also can create paint points for himself off the dribble … Capable of posting up and shooting/scoring over smaller defenders or drawing fouls on bigger defenders … Has nice range on his jumper … His size and versatility allows him to play either forward position (in college), causing mismatch problems … Makes smart plays in transition, whether it’s attacking the basket and drawing a foul or finding an open teammate … Runs the floor well on the fast break … Strong finisher around the basket in the half court and in transition … Finds open areas along the baseline really well when driving to the basket for scores … Capable of scoring with either hand at the rim and around the basket … Creates opportunities for his teammates by being active on both ends of the floor … Reliable and unafraid to take and make big shots … Wants the ball in his hands late in games … Can carry a team’s scoring load for long stretches of a game … Has shown great leadership qualities on and off the court … Very durable …","Heavy feet for a 3 … Does not possess great quickness in the half court and is seen as somewhat of a tweener for the next level … Lack of quickness and speed off the dribble makes it tougher for him to get by longer, quicker, bigger and more athletic defenders … Shot selection (mostly with his jumper) is an issue at times … Average free throw shooter (but is improving) … Can tighten up his ball-handling in traffic … Needs to polish his ability to shoot the ball off the dribble … Gets caught up in playing at a fast pace so he shoots before he’s set or too early in the shot clock … Forces some shots … Does not get to the line as much as he probably should … Has an average of just 4.1 free throw attempts per game over the course of his collegiate career … Not much of a shot creator for his teammates … Averaged just 1.1 assists throughout his career … The ball tends to stick in his hands when his gets it, resulting in a high usage rate and low assist rate … Tends to dominate the ball with his left hand … Needs to improve his perimeter defense, both on and off the ball … Lateral movement needs to be improved as opposing guards can beat him off the dribble consistently … Not great at defending off the bounce…Sometimes lack awareness of his defensive positioning and loses shooters …",77,215,23.48
