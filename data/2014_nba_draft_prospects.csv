Andrew Wiggins,1,"Off the charts run/jump athleticism … Lateral quickness and length also gives him great potential as a perimeter defender, along with versatility to guard both wing positions efficiently … Incredibly dangerous in transition opportunities, long strider with a quick first step, did a great job of scoring or getting fouled when getting out in transition … Shooting mechanics have improved greatly, with quickness enough to get his shot off under tight defense … Got to the FT stripe at a good rate, making 77.5% of his attempts … As an offensive rebounder, can keep possessions alive that very few others can due to his second jump and tremendous leaping ability … Challenged defensively at Kansas, often asked to guard the other teams leading scorer on the wing, doing an admirable job … Unselfish, will look for teammates and is an evolving playmaker … Spin move can become a major weapon in isolation, plus has shown a floater that over time could become a weapon … When being closely defended, his step back jumper has also been a move that is tough to guard … Plays with a quiet intensity and while some question his lack of emotion, also never gets to down … When he has been challenged, has shown an ability to step up to the challenge … Son of a former NBA player and an Olympic sprinter, has an understanding of the game and a knowledge of where to get to on the court … Conditioning is fantastic, played major minutes as a freshman and should be able to carry a solid work load immediately … Ability to run the floor is elite and ensures a certain level of success at NBA level …  Very skinny but has the broad shoulders to add weight if he’s determined to … Showed an increased understanding of his role and got much lower on defense as the year progressed at Kansas, looks to be quite coachable … Aside from a poor final tournament game, seemed to be playing his best basketball as the season came to a close, including a huge 40 plus point breakout performance against West Virginia …","The biggest issue is whether or not Wiggins has the mental make up to maximize his immense physical gifts. While some scouts are extremely high on him, there are just as many that question his focus and passion for the game … Often plays too upright on offense, which can get him off his base and lead to turnovers … Needs to work on moving without the ball, has a reputation of sometimes standing, ball watching … Defensive awareness is something he must work on, along with always running out to his spot and not relying completely on length, athleticism to challenge a player … Still needs to add upper body strength, had issues finishing around the basket and getting knocked off of his spot when defensive rebounding … Long range shot is still not overly consistent, sometimes turns his hand outward on follow through … Often loose with dribble, sometimes has the ball too high and gets exploited when double teamed … Some question his lack of assertiveness offensively, which calls into question his ability to be a primary option on a high level team … Battled inconsistency and struggled against physical defense, which could point to strength as well as a sign of shaky confidence … Should look to become a more vocal leader … Too often settled for long range shots and did not venture out of his comfort zone enough, still has many things to learn in terms of creating mid range shots and counter moves … Had a difficult time establishing post position, something that could be a crucial next step to utilize his quickness and size as a wing at the next level … Has been compared to Kobe Bryant, but the biggest difference appears to be the attention to detail. So far, granted Kobe’s is extremely rare, Wiggins has been lacking in this area. Will he develop this critical aspect in order to polish his all around game to achieve greatness?",80,200,19.35
Jabari Parker,2,"Parker is on another level from his peers, skill wise … Very strong, bulky forward with elite level face up game for his age … An underrated athlete; Parker plays a smooth, if not overpowering brand of ball, and  is more likely to muscle through opponents than blow by them … Possesses very good hands … Shows the ability to grasp nuances of the game … Has a passion for basketball, and this comes out in his play … A la Paul Pierce, is especially good at step back jumper, and can do it in both directions … Creates a ton of separation with his step back … Can go to work in the post, especially against smaller and weaker defenders … Will likely be developed as a small forward in the NBA, where he will immediately become one of the largest and strongest at this position … Work ethic is phenomenal … Really wants to be a leader; wants to be great … Even in high school, practiced with the focus of a pro … Has been a winner every step of the way of his career; won four straight Illinois State Titles in high school … Can create for teammates thanks to his high basketball IQ and overall play making ability … Commands so much attention from opposing defenses that teammates will find themselves with more opportunities to receive the ball in a position to score with him on the floor …  Can finish with both hands around the hoop … Solid, but not great ability to knock down the NBA 3-ball … Had some impressive dunks in his freshman season at Duke, which proved that he does possess the hops and explosiveness that he often does not get credit for … Also showed surprising body control and ball handling, weaving through defenders for finishes at the rim in the open floor …","Defense and position are the two biggest questions with Parker … Some wonder whether he is quick enough to guard on the perimeter, or if he is long enough to defend the post … Has been given the ""tweener"" label that no draft prospect wants associated with his name … Appears to carry some extra ""baby fat"" … Somewhat slow release on the jumper, and it has a hitch; may need to tweak release to improve scoring opportunities against athletic defenders who match his size … Can he expand his range to be a reliable 3-point shooter? … Was asked to play in the post defensively for Duke, which may lead to an even bigger learning curve for Parker as he improves his understanding of how to guard wings in the NBA … Not a particularly crafty defender; surprising given how intelligent an offensive player he is …",81,240,19.3
Joel Embiid,3,"The sculpted Embiid has a prototypical body for an NBA center, standing 7 feet tall, with a 7.5-foot reach, and weighing 250 pounds. He could use more muscle, but his frame should have no trouble bearing the additional bulk … Posted outstanding per-40-minutes numbers in his lone season at Kansas, averaging 19.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 4.5 blocks … An agile and mobile center, with nimble feet, good speed, great quickness, and vertical explosiveness … Excellent around the rim, scoring regularly on put-backs and alley opps.  According to Hoop-Math.com, Embiid made 76.3 percent of his attempts at the rim this past season…  His offensive game is still a work in progress, but the potential is there.  His offensive arsenal includes very quick drop-steps, jump hooks, and turn-around jumpers … Uses a variety of ball and body fakes to create space for his shot, including the renowned “Dream Shake.” … Draws a bunch of fouls (8.8 per 40 minutes), and makes a respectable 69 percent of his free-throw attempts … An active and aggressive weak-side defender …  Covers a lot of ground with his length and huge strides … Stats don’t tell the full story – on the defensive end, he alters a number of shots and is generally disruptive … Not timid – willing to put a body on someone and mix it up in the paint …  Sets solid screens … Doesn’t panic when double teamed …","Embiid had trouble staying on the floor, either due to injuries or foul trouble.  In a total of 28 games at KU, he played fewer than 20 minutes 10 times and more than 30 minutes only three times … Questionable durability – this past season, he missed one game (Feb. 15) due to a knee injury, played in the four following games, and then was shut down for the rest of the year due to a stress fracture in his lower back. He also dealt with lower back issues as a senior in high school … Averaged a whopping 5.9 fouls per 40 minutes at KU … Lacks both offensive and defensive awareness … Averaged 4.2 turnovers per 40 minutes at KU …  Defensively, he frequently focuses too much on the ball and loses track of his man … Was at times pushed off the block by bigger centers … Seems to get frustrated when not heavily involved in the offense or not making his shots.  At those times, his play appears to be a bit lackadaisical …",84,250,20.29
Aaron Gordon,4,"A very athletic and versatile PF … Is a very active and energetic type of athlete, showing great leaping ability and explosiveness … Plays with a high motor… Physically lean, but is a wiry strong player who doesn’t  shy away from contact … Shows a very good nose for the ball … Always must be accounted for on box outs, as he is a very good offensive rebounder and shows an outstanding 1st and 2nd jump … High IQ player, who plays to his strengths and generally makes quick and precise decisions … Is an excellent passer for a guy who is generally considered a PF prospect (2 apg as a Fr.), and is a good decision maker as well … Moves well without the ball around the rim, and makes himself available for easy buckets … An alley-oop magnet with huge suction cup hands …Usually finishes with authority … Has a good enough 1st step to sporadically create his own shot on straight line drives to his right … Impressive defensive skills … Defended some at every position while at Arizona, and generally was excellent considering his relative inexperience … Contests every jump shot and is very disciplined on closeouts … Adequate shot-blocker … Understands the concept of help side defense better than a typical young player, which should allow him to play minutes immediately in the NBA … Very focused … An extremely well-conditioned athlete, who rarely gets tired or makes “lazy” plays … Seems like a great glue guy and role player, and isn’t the type of player who needs a lot of plays run for him to be effective … Will fit in well on a team in need to energy and athleticism … Pretty competitive player who doesn’t show a lack of effort often, which will always please his coaches … Still extremely young, won’t turn 19 until about a month or so before the 2014-2015 season …","Gordon’s main weaknesses revolve around his lacking skill level on the offensive side of the ball …Despite being the 2nd leading scorer on an Arizona squad that almost made it to the Final 4, Gordon needs extensive improvement offensively … His ball-handling ability is not very good right now, and he loses significant effectiveness the more he dribbles the ball … Rarely looks comfortable with his back to the rim … Not blessed with a soft touch, which suggests he will continue to have his struggles as a jump shooter, and from the line … Doesn’t seem to have a lot of range on his shot, even though he can occasionally hit 22 footers … Struggled mightily at the foul line in his only year in school (42%) and needs to work on his form, develop a little more sense of urgency and develop a set routine which replicates his mid range shot, and eliminates the ""long pause"" … Has a very deliberate and slow shot, sometimes it looks like the ball barely rotates when he shoots … Physically, Gordon has adequate height and strength, but he could use a little more bulk to his frame … Could get sealed by bigger PF’s in the NBA due to his narrow frame … Not particularly lengthy … Some consider Gordon a bit of a tweener, it will be interesting to see what type of body weight he can ultimately carry comfortably … Was determined to show that he was a small forward, but scouts view him strictly as a 4 for the next level … Needs to work on his footwork, as he picks up traveling calls often when trying to create … Has high/tight hips and it sometimes shows in his lateral movements … Has a very awkward running style, and while some compare it to Rodman with the way he runs on his toes, Gordon’s extremely short stride has drawn some concerns … Though very good on the offensive glass, Gordon sometimes shows raw awareness on the defensive glass and will forget to box out or be in the wrong places when the ball has been shot …",81,220,18.79
Dante Exum,5,"The 18-year-old Aussie is a fluid and versatile athlete, who shows a great deal of potential … Good size for a guard, and should fill out nicely over time …  Excels at getting to the basket and drawing fouls … Finishes through contact and can score with either hand …  Excellent body control allows him to make very acrobatic shots at the rim … Opposing defenders are constantly off-balance due to his effective hesitation moves and explosive first step …  Moves well without the ball – makes good use of screens and does it at a relatively high rate of speed … Can create scoring opportunities for both himself and his teammates … Just scratching the surface in certain areas of his game – effective at making floaters, shooting off the step-back and posting up, but does not use these skills very often … Improving as an outside shooter – smooth and elevates well off the dribble … Very versatile – used at the 1, 2, and 3 spots … An active and alert team defender – his length and speed allows him to cover a lot of ground … Comes up with a lot of steals and loose balls … Does a little bit of everything, and is willing to do whatever is needed to win, including setting screens and mixing it up in the paint … A good kid – is coachable, affable, grounded, humble, and intelligent …","Level of competition is the biggest knock against Exum. He has not proven himself against a high enough level of competition to make anyone feel completely comfortable drafting him in the top 5 … Some of his best performances have come in games (Under 19 World Championships) where he appeared to be one of the most physically advanced players … Playing for the Australian National Team, he was given free reign to create offense for himself. Can he be as succesful without being given the same level of freedom? … Exum has played off the ball a lot, and he doesn’t appear ready to be a true point guard … His handle is loose at times – has the ball poked away too often and occasionally fumbles when changing hands or directions … Not an exceptional facilitator – makes too many ill-advised passes … Inconsistent outside shot – does not always get enough elevation and has a low release point, especially when his feet are set (catch-and-shoot) …  Trajectory on his shot appears flat at times … Settles for long-distance threes too often … Not vertically explosive and struggles to finish with authority. For a player who thrives off of beating defenders off the dribble, his lack of ability to explode and finish with the best of them is concerning … Tends to drive to the left and shoot with his right … Struggles at the free-throw line, shooting around 65% in International competitions … Can he develop his body and become a tough player capable of finishing with contact?",78,196,18.97
Marcus Smart,6,"Strong, heady point guard with great size and instincts…Uses his mixture of quickness, strength, instincts, and aggressiveness to get to the rim, then uses his big frame and excellent body control to finish through contact…In addition to his scoring ability, Smart doubles as an excellent passer and playmaker.  He has great court vision and is willing to make the unselfish play to set up his teammates.  Averaged 5.8 assists per 40 minutes last season…Very sound perimeter defender who has the length (6’8"" wingspan), the strength, and the lateral quickness to keep his man in front of him.  Plays hard and harasses ball handlers into making bad decisions…Draws multiple defenders on his drives, then has the alertness to kick it out to an open teammate for a 3…Ball-hawking defender who averaged around 3 SPG throughout his college career.  Once again, his big wingspan helps him terrorize the passing lanes…His aggression and power allow him to get to the line at an excellent rate.  Shot over 8 free throws per game last season in just over 32 MPG…Great rebounding point guard due to his size and strength.  Averaged nearly 6 rebound a game last season…His height and his strength also allow him to post up smaller point guards and finish inside…Loves to get out in transition and has the vision and finishing ability to make him elite at running the fast break…Can play with guard position and can also defend multiple positions due to his size/quickness combo…Has a nose for the ball.  Will dive on the floor to get loose balls and will rip it out of the offensive player’s hands from time to time…Shows flashes of greatness in the pick-and-roll as both a scorer and a passer…Outside shot can be effective when Smart is on his game, making him a great inside-outside weapon…Makes winning plays.  His decision-making is excellent and he is great at balancing setting up teammates and making a scoring play himself…Raised his PPG (18.0 to 19.9) nearly 2 points per game in games against ranked opponents last season…Great motor and energy.  Puts it all on the line every minute of every game and always plays with intensity and competitiveness…Has that other-worldliness, always-in-control, do-what-it-takes-to-win, elite factor that a select few point guards (Kemba Walker, Trey Burke) in recent drafts have exhibited…","Not a great outside shooter.  Only made 29% from distance last season.  Needs to polish his mechanics and hit on a more consistent basis.  Struggles mightily on jumpers when guarded.  Release slowed by bringing the ball down to his knees before rising up and releasing.  Simply needs to be more consistent with his shot mechanics…Opponents will find it easier to stay in front of Smart because they don’t have to guard him as tight and respect his jumper…Not a very efficient scorer.  Needs to take smarter jump shots and not settle for pull-up threes…Could stand to be more patient and unselfish rather than forcing it and becoming dead-set on taking a shot at times…His assist/turnover ratio of 1.78 is not great.  Could certainly cut down on turnovers and be more patient on offense.  His aggression can sometimes be a weakness.  It also leads to offensive fouls on occasion…Mediocre ballhandler, another source of his turnover problems…Uses his physical gifts well, but ultimately doesn’t have great athleticism…Free throw percentage dropped from 78% to 73% between his freshman and sophomore seasons…Interestingly enough, Smart’s knack for making winning plays did not generally carry over to crunch time.  In 7 Cowboys games that Smart played in this season that were decided by 3 or fewer points or in overtime, Smart shot a mere 3/14 (21%) from the field in the final two minutes and overtime of those games.  He also missed several free throws in that span…Can be a bit of a ""flopper""…Smart’s teams have lost in their first game in the NCAA Tournament in each of the past two years, despite being expected to win both times.  The Cowboys also went on a big-time skid to end the Big 12 regular season, due, in part, to Smart’s suspension and inability to right the ship as the team point guard and star player…NBA scouts will have the Texas Tech incident fresh in their minds, when Smart lost his cool and shoved a fan, earning him a three-game suspension.  Smart doesn’t always maintain his composure, which can force him to make bad decisions both in and out of gameplay, and doesn’t always have a grey attitude or body language on the court.  This incident could have scared away a few teams at the top of the draft…",75,227,20.32
Julius Randle,7,"Very strong upper body and a reliable left hand … He shows a strong motor, and finishes well around the rim with contact … He is very skilled with his face up game and has shown some creative finishing ability … He is very dangerous on P&R and Pick and Pop, because of his ability to hit mid-range jumpers … Though he lacks elite explosiveness, he is able to use his strong frame to protect the ball and avoid blocks … On the offensive boards he is an absolute beast, relentless in seeking out rebounds … The same thing is true on the defensive end where he has natural instincts for rebounds … A pretty good post defender, he uses his strong body to not allow taller opponents to get close to the rim … He doesn’t have the quickest feet in the world, but definitely really good for a big, very balanced … Potentially he can switch on P&R situations for a couple of dribbles, but needs to improve on his showing … Randle is a mix of power, skills and balance that makes him a very interesting prospect … Despite being just a freshman he could have an immediate impact in the NBA due to his strength and offensive skills … He has drawn positive reviews for his attitude and coach-ability and appears to be a hard working kid that leaves everything on the floor every game and every practice …","Despite all the good things mentioned about his game there are a lot of concerns about Randle … In a way Randle’s high energy, ""bully ball"" style of playing reminds some of how Shabazz, at a different position, overpowered people last year and we’ve seen how much the former UCLA small forward has struggled in the league … It’s been noted that Randle is undersized for the PF position, lacking ideal length with a sub 7 foot wingspan … He may struggle to create looks against stronger, more athletic and taller opponents in the post … Offensively his numbers on synergy indicate how difficult it has been for him to score on post moves with very low percentages on each low post block and over either shoulder … It also doesn’t help matters that he is not able to utilize his right hand … Very few, even highly talented, players are able to play at high level without being able to finish and make moves with both hands, as the book becomes well known and everyone overplays their strength. I’m not sure if Randle fits this category, but the fear is there … His shooting isn’t consistent and despite good mechanics, his percentages are low and 3pts range is non-existent … He will have to develop a consistent solid jumpshot to replicate the success of Zach Randolph and Michael Beasley when facing the basket … Overall his game right now is based almost entirely on overpowering weaker opponents … He is very skilled but it will be hard to find the same success overpowering post players in the league. Also it is worth considering that most of Randle’s game is below the rim … His future will likely hinge more heavily than most prospects on landing in the right system, where a team has a vision of how to utilize him and makes sure he stays focused and works hard on the right skill development … A bad team or loss or focus could pose a huge risk to his NBA career …",81,250,19.59
Nik Stauskas,8,"Pure shooter with a picture perfect stroke and excellent range (44% career 3 point shooter) … Gets his feet set quickly and gets solid elevation on his jumper. Long arms also help him to get his shot off … Crafty, cerebral player who maximizes his athletic ability. Good at making adjustments during plays … Fiery competitor. Appears to lack a conscience and does not shy away from the limelight … Very smooth offensive game. Shows the ability to spot up for shots, as well as get shots off the dribble and has shown a solid ability to hit shots without much daylight … Improved considerably from FR to SO season. To his credit has worked hard to expand his game beyond just shooting, becoming a solid pick and role facilitator, even running the point during stretches in his sophomore year … Surprising leaper off of two feet and if he gets an open lane to the basket, uses his excellent length for some exciting two handed finishes at the rim … Ball handling is good for 2 guard … Has embraced the role of go to scorer and become the #1 option for Michigan this season … Solid a/to ratio shows good decision making and ball protection … Could fill the role of a 3 point shooting specialist, a la Steve Kerr, if his shot remains as effective from NBA 3 …","Although he’s viewed as more than just a shooter, his lack of overall speed could relegate him into being a one dimensional (spot up threat) pro … Not the most fluid of athletes. Lack of foot speed and overall quickness will make running defenders off screens to get open more challenging. This also affects his on ball ability to get by athletic defenders, and create shot opportunities … While his level of foot speed makes him very effective against college athletes, there is concern that he may struggle to find the same success against bigger, stronger, quicker athletes. Has been less effective when matching up against top shelf opposing guards. Lacks physicality. Gets pushed under the basket on drives easily. Has had a few games where he has been completely shut down (0-2 fg, 4 pts vs Duke) … Struggles on the defensive end against stronger and quicker opponents … Lack of foot speed hurts defensively … A good leaper off of 2 feet, but lacks a high level of overall run/jump athleticism and lateral speed … Body appears to be filled out, so how much stronger his legs and overall body can get are questionable …",78,207,20.73
Noah Vonleh,9,"Ideal PF size with very long arms and the skill set that had many envisioning him as a wing while in high school … Has shown flashes of potential to stretch the defense, as well as a rapidly developing post game, helped by his solid frame … Will not be 19 until August, which again brings to mind the potential growth his body and game could go through, along with the fantastic size and coordination he already possesses … Was a great rebounder during his freshman season, very aggressive on both ends of the floor hitting the glass … Gets out on the break and runs very well for his size. Shows very good mobility for a player with his size and strength, moves his feet especially well considering his thick, tree trunk legs … His combination of length, size and mobility made him a factor on that side of the floor, along with having major upside on that end with increased experience, awareness … Showed a good shot selection, shot a high percentage from the field and line, even showing ability out to three point range that could be developed down the line … Surprising ability to put the ball on the floor with decent mobility, along with range that should have defenders respecting his shot … Gets to the line fairly often and shot 71.3% FT as a freshman … Definitely passionate about basketball, has shown a will to improve and put in work … Cerebral kid.

Despite possessing great offensive tools, he took relatively few shots for a team banking on him to be a 2nd scoring option … Relies more on length than athletic ability, could also be questions about whether adding additional weight slows him down even more than it has seemed to since growing into the 4 spot … Needs work on his low post footwork, still adjusting to life as a PF as opposed to playing on the wing … On court awareness on both ends is still a work in progress, sometimes he lacks a bit of focus which could be attributed to lack of confidence and inexperience … Got into foul trouble fairly often, needs to play defense more with his feet than his arms … While his offensive skill set is tantalizing, some question whether he will develop the killer mentality that would make him into a viable top scoring option … Though his range projects to be a strength, he still needs work on being a reliable midrange and distance shooter … Turned it over quite a bit, which goes along with developing more court awareness",81,247,18.85

Dario Saric,12,"At 6’10 it is very hard to find anyone in the world with the skills he possesses to play with or without the ball anywhere on the court … He can push it in transition as well as posting up with good results … His feel for the game is what really separates him from many other “Point forwards” … In Europe he can easily play as a 3 or 4 thanks to his court vision and decision making, very rare for a player of his height … Perhaps his 2nd greatest strength is his aggressiveness on the boards … He really is able to capture rebounds and quickly transform those rebounds in transition opportunity directly pushing the ball or making accurate outlet passes to teammates … Another really underrated quality of Saric is his IQ and understanding of spacing, on both ends of the floor. His development as a point guard early in his basketball career have given him a tremendous feel for the game … He is able to overcome his lack of athleticism many times being in the right spot in the right moment … Obviously his versatility is attractive to scouts, as he seems to have many ways to impact games, not having to rely on one skill … While his shooting mechanics need work, his percentages are much higher with his feet set … His determination and basketball IQ are really what makes him such an attractive prospect, and the hope will be that he can overcome his limitations through desire, hard work and dedication …","Saric would have a much better NBA outlook if not for his lack of foot speed and athleticism … His quickness and elevation might be enough to finish in Europe, but without the ability to finish above the rim, things will likely prove more difficult for him in the NBA … He is quick and mobile for a player his height but clearly lacks the foot speed to stay in front of NBA wing forwards … In addition he lacks ideal strength to battle NBA PFs on the block … He projects as a 4, despite his excellent face the basket skills, due to his size and lack of foot speed. Sort of a stretch 4 without great shooting ability … The best way to describe Saric’s game is a jack of all trades, master of nothing type … His lack of quickness will not allow him to beat anybody off the dribble 1 on 1, and the inconsistent shooting will not help in creating offense … In transition he will still be able to create but despite a good use of both ends his lack of explosiveness above the rim makes every lay-up very blockable …  3 turnovers per game are way too much for a player like him and it shows his lack of good decision making on a consistent base. In the NBA facing better athletes, it will be harder and harder for him to be effective in offense … Things get worse if we take a look at his shooting percentages. The mechanics are not one of a pure shooter, and he is making only 30% of his 3 pointers right now … With a longer NBA 3 point line it is safe to assume those percentages will not go up, though to his credit when he is in rhythm and his feet are set he can make around 40% at FIBA level … Defensively as we said, he struggles to defend both the 3 and the 4 positions. His wingspan is just 6’10 so he will be much harder for him to recover from his lack of foot speed … He does play really hard, and seems to have an aggressive mentality on every play but he will have to overcome many weaknesses and really develop as a player and as an athlete in the next couple of years to have a legitimate impact in the NBA …",82,225,20.23
Zach LaVine,13,"Blessed with truly high level explosiveness, LaVine was one of the most intriguing prospects in college basketball last season … Shows electric speed and quickness, and is certainly one of the best leapers in the 2014 draft class … Really good body control as well … Pretty long … His upside as a prospect has a way of jumping out of the TV screen when you watch him play … Plays an exciting and fairly flashy style, and is a highlight reel dunker in the transition game … Is a magnet for run-outs, as his speed and acceleration allows him to generally be one of the first players down the floor after missed shots … Has a sweet looking jump shot, and his range extends past the NBA 3-point line … Also blessed with a swift (yet unorthodox) release and a strong ability to create space to get his shots off … Able to hit shots off of screens or off the dribble, making him a guy who must be accounted for no matter what on the perimeter … More than adequate ball-handling ability … Will be a tough cover due to his athleticism and shooting skills, as he can slash when crowded or stop and pop if the defender gives him space … Gets great elevation and has a high release giving him a great ability to get shots off … Has the ability to put up points in bunches … Already garnered experience playing as an instant offense threat off the bench in his lone year at UCLA, and that role will likely benefit him at the NBA level, as he gains experience … Would likely be most effective playing in an up-tempo system … Some think LaVine could develop into a combo guard at the next level, and he has the physical and athletic tools to do so … Shows finesse as a player, and is extremely fluid and smooth … A late blooming prospect, who wasn’t a highly touted recruit until midway through his Sr. season of high school … Could really just be scratching the surface of his true ability …","LaVine needs to develop more consistency and improve his basketball IQ … Has a tendency to settle for too many pull up jump shots and doesn’t attack the basket nearly as much as he should off the dribble … Got to the foul line at a poor rate for someone with his shot creating potential  last season (1.8 FTA per night on 69%) … Pretty thin and frail, needs to put on more weight … Not a physical player at all, and really struggles with any aspect of the game dealing with contact right now … Has a raw feel for the game, and decides to take some bad shots at times … Though he’s projected by many to be a combo guard, LaVine didn’t show a great ability to handle double teams and struggled some when pressured … Is a pretty underwhelming defensive player, and will have a tough time finding consistent minutes on an NBA team until he shows more effort and strength on this end … Doesn’t seem to be a very tough player. Body strength will obviously help his ability to play through contact … Though he has good shooting skills, his jumper faded badly down the stretch last season and rendered him pretty ineffective throughout the month of March … Struggles mightily to contribute when his jumper isn’t falling … Is a very promising prospect, but will need time to develop overall before he’s ready to play consistently in the NBA …",78,180,19.31
TJ Warren,14,"Warren is a big time scorer and a guy with fantastic instincts for the game … He works very hard on both ends of the floor and has a knack for finding openings in the defense to put the ball in the hoop, in other words, he’s very opportunistic … This ties in with his offensive rebounding as well, he always seems to be in the right position … He’s excellent in transition and runs the floor extremely well … Works well both on and off the ball … He can spot up and knock down jumpers from deep, he can set up his man and beat them via backdoor cuts or he can create for himself … He has range from all over the floor, although he’s best from midrange, and is surprisingly comfortable handling the ball … Lost some weight and looks more athletic this year … Will overpower lesser athletes around the basket playing bully ball … He is becoming more of a wing from a skill standpoint … Defensively he puts forth a great effort, and rebounds very well.","The obvious weakness is that he doesn’t have a defined position … He lacks athleticism at the wing, and he’s small for a post player with short arms … Regardless of where he plays he’s going to be at an athletic disadvantage due to poor lateral quickness and being a less athletic player … After shooting excellent from deep as a freshman, he has struggled from 3 this season, though his numbers have picked up as the season has progressed …",80,220,20.82
Adreian Payne,15,"An explosive big with shooting range to the college 3-point line … Shot a very impressive 42.3% on 3.4 3-point attempts per game as a college senior … Payne should be a quality ""pick and pop"" option in the NBA because of his toughness and shooting stroke … Very good free throw shooter (about 80% in his final two seasons at MSU) … He comes off as being a bit stiff in his movements, but is as explosive off 2 feet as they come …  A banger on the block.  Has decent post moves and a good stroke … Improving feel around the basket and in the post, especially when it comes to making a counter move and passing out of double teams …  Known to be an ""intangibles"" guy who is a good leader and hard worker … Physical.  Has toughness you’d expect from an Izzo coached player … Wiry strong — entered MSU with a slender frame but has filled out well … Appears to be the type of player that is even stronger than he looks … Really showed off his athleticism in the college dunk contest, where many agree he had the most impressive dunk of the event, doing a 360 while bringing the ball down to his feet mid-air before throwing it down with authority.","Though he has excellent physical tools, has not necessarily learned to translate his athleticism, along with his 7′ wingspan, into becoming a smart shot blocker due to poor timing on defense … Not a threat to create for teammates or make plays off the dribble …  Known to be a force on the boards, but rebounding numbers decreased (from 7.6 to 7.3 rpg), despite an increase in playing time, senior year vs. prior year …  Remains to be seen if he can excel in an up-and-down system … May struggle to play extended minutes — reportedly has reduced lung capacity.  Concerns over his lung capacity can probably be weathered by looking at the big picture; Payne projects as a role player, who would not typically be relied on for more than about 28 mpg — which matches his senior season average at MSU …  Takes a while to get set on his jump shot and has a tendency to bring the ball down to his waist to start his shooting motion, even if he catches the ball high.  However, he does have a high final release point …",82,240,23.36
Jusuf Nurkic,16,"Standing at 6’11”, he has an amazing balance and mobility for the center position … He possesses a really solid and robust frame, almost 280 lb, combined with a solid 7’2” wingspan, so he’s well suited to banging in the post at the NBA level … He possesses excellent footwork which makes him really effective in pick and roll situations … soft hands and touch, he’s able to conclude with the hook shot in the painted area using both hands (even if he should improve the use of his left) after the spin move … A solid free throw shooter, a good weapon since with his frame he’s able to draw contact quite effectively … He plays with energy and intensity below the boards, he’s not scared of contact …Good rebounder. Defensively he has a great potential with his remarkable lateral speed and quick hands … He has a remarkable feel for the game and basketball instincts, with several of the offensive possessions of his team usually passing through his hands.","He’s not a huge leaper or very explosive, his physical game is based on his strength so he could struggle against bigger and longer opponents on both ends of the floor … Even if he has shown remarkable potential on the defensive end, one of his biggest flaws is his tendency to be foul prone, due to the lack of discipline (fundamentals, positioning) and attitude … This combined with his temper and the consequent arguments with referees limit his utilization on the court to an average of 15 minutes per game … There are some concerns regarding his maturity and his behavior on/off the court … His game is basically instinctive, based on his natural talent, but he should work on his game comprehension, reducing turnovers and forced shots …",83,280,19.85
James Young,17,"Young is a very talented scorer who can beat you in a variety of ways, his jump shot being the most notable. He’s very confident in his ability to hit from deep and can knock shots down off the dribble, while being tightly guard, coming off of screens or spotting up. His release is quick and he looks like a guy who could become an expert marksmen with time. Has excellent size for his position at 6’6-6’7 with a good wingspan and a 215 lb frame that looks like it could easily add another 10-20 lbs. With his length and more experience he could potentially become a fantastic defensive player. He’s a lefty and is young for his class so he could potentially grow some more. Crafty offensive player who finds ways to put points on the board. Plays with good energy. Excellent body control and finishes well through contact. One of the better rebounders at his position. Appears to have a good head on his shoulders and is a functional passer.","At this point doesn’t have a go-to skill that sticks out. He’s merely good in most areas as opposed to great. His jumper is still streaky and he has a tendency to take some bad shots early in possessions. Not a special leaper and lacks a degree of quickness which means he may be more of a small forward than a shooting guard. Despite his frame he could still add a good deal of strength. His ball handling needs tightening as he’s usually most effective only utilizing a few dribbles and his right hand needs work. Lack of driving ability renders him somewhat one dimensional offensively, if his outside shot is not falling he can shut down. Lacks a lot of experience at this stage and it shows defensively with his gambling. It also shows up in his decision making at times and it’s hard to grasp how great is basketball IQ is at this point.",78,215,18.87
Tyler Ennis,18,"Extremely cerebral and unselfish point guard. Competitive desire to win and very team oriented … A clever floor general.

Gets a lot of steals playing the passing lanes … Great vision in transition. Often finds the open man halfway down the court … Can drive and finish with either hand … Good rebounding guard … Has been remarkably careful with the ball for a freshman point guard. Has no more than two turnovers in any of Syracuse’s games this season … Turns it over once every 26 minutes … Perfectionist. Shows a lot of attention to detail. At 19 years old, Ennis is still a very young prospect with many years of potential growth ahead of him. Being such a cerebral kid, there’s reason to believe he will continue to improve well into his mid / late 20s … 6’5"" wingspan helps make him the disruptive defender that he is and his wingspan helps make up for his mediocre height … Versatile scorer. Can make shots off the dribble or the catch-and-shoot at a high rate … Very mature overall player for being so young. He shouldn’t have too much trouble transitioning to the NBA compared to other players his age … Very adept running the pick-and-roll … Also shows solid ability defending the pick and roll …","Lacks elite level speed and athleticism. Though he will at times surprise with both … Ennis gets a lot of steals, but he’s not the best or most fundamentally sound perimeter defender … Playing in Syracuse’s system, he will have to learn one on one defensive techniques at the next level … Has always had a cast of great teammates around him and could be less impressive when playing against defenders on par with his teammates … He’s a decent athlete and his IQ and instincts help him tremendously, but he’s ultimately not the most athletic point guard … Thin frame …",74,180,19.85

Bruno Caboclo,20,"Just 18 years of age and one of the youngest players in the draft, Bruno is a prospect with rare physical gifts possessing a 7-foot-7 wingspan … He oozes upside with his impressive wingspan, broad shoulders, big hands and long legs … A good leaper, explosive jumping ability, very fluid, runs the court like a guard, which he uses to take advantage of slower and less athletic players … On top of the physical gifts, Bruno has solid form on his shot … He is extremely adept facing the basket and even shows the ability to knock down 3 point shots … Also shows some back to the basket abilities, utilizing hook shots … He is still very thin but has a good body and can easily add weight and get stronger without losing any quickness and athleticism … He has a soft touch around the basket and finishes well with dunks and lay ins … He is an interesting player on defense, as he has good timing for blocked shots, utilizing his great length and shows good defense against taller SFs and quicker PFs … Good motor. A good rebounder, especially on the offense end …","Undoubtably a project, Bruno will need a lot of time before he will be ready to play at the NBA level … His entire (short) career has been played in Brazil, so it’s uncertain how he will handle moving to the US and the rise in level of competition … He is still completely unproven having only played in a minor league with limited minutes and in not so competitive games … So it is difficult to translate his game to the NBA, he must work his intensity and aggressiveness on both ends of the court. He’ll need to gain strength and learn how to play against stronger players … He plays more like a power foward at this point than a small forward, as his ball handling skills are limited … As a natural PF he must work his ball handling skills to put the ball on the floor to be a SF wich is his better position to play on future, on defense he can improve his rebound instincts and his lateral displacement to play against SF on NBA.

Jordan Adams,22,"His greatest attributes are his scoring ability and competitiveness … He is a player who really wants to win and will sell out for the team … Many scorers’ use the defensive end for 35 seconds of rest time, or don’t crash the boards hard … Adams instead seeks an opportunity to score at all time … While on defense he is great in anticipating passing lanes and jumping them to get out on a fast break … He always sprints to the offensive half court to find easy points … On offense he crashes the paint using his big body to finish around the rim … He is also a master of cuts, exploiting his teammate Anderson’s ability to create from the dribble. Adams often back cuts behind his defender for an easy layup … Despite being a scorer, Adams doesn’t dislike passing the ball, finishing the season with more than two assists per game … Perhaps the most effective part of his game is his mid-range game which is reminiscent of Rip Hamilton (though much different body type) … Adams does a great job in reading his defender on screens for jump shots (Alford work with him on reading screens certainly helped him improve this part of his game) and is great in using his strong upper body to put his defender ""in jail"" to finish with floaters or around the rim, though he is not exactly an top athlete … He also has really good post moves for a guard, often taking advantage of smaller guards to score or get fouled …","As noted Adams isn’t a great athlete. He doesn’t necessarily needs to be a great athlete to succeed in the League, but it will for sure make his life harder when he will have to score in the paint … I’m not sure that he can finish so easily over NBA bigs, he will have to take his mid-range game to an even higher level … And it will make his life a lot harder on the defensive end where he will have to show the ability to stay in front of his opponents … His lateral speed and foot speed aren’t where a NBA coach would like to have it but the strength of his upper body could help to handle the contact … The other knock on his game is how inconsistent he is as a 3pts shooter and particularly on close out situations … According to synergy in those situations when the defender is recovering on him he tends to shoot 81% of the time with very low percentages: 28%, well below average for a guard and clearly not the numbers you would expect from a player like him … He needs to become a much more consistent shooter or decision maker on close outs to be successful in the NBA, where particularly initially he will have to take advantage of those opportunities to show his value before having screens and plays run for him …",77,209,19.98

KJ McDaniels,32,"KJ is obviously an outstanding athlete; he can jump really easily off two feet or of one without any difference. In the last year he finally used this gift to become one of the best rebounders in his conference while only 6’6 … He is particularly dangerous on the offensive glass, where if he doesn’t have a body on him he knows how to get the crowd involved with spectacular tip dunks … Transition is another area where he shines, both as a ball handler or runner on the wing, when he has the ball and there is nobody in his lane he goes strong to the basket,  very often making the right decision … When he is off the ball in transition he’s often catching lobs and alley-oops … This part of his game will really stand out in the NBA, particularly for teams with good PGs and that like to push the ball in transition … He also added to his game a respectable 3 point jumper, not very pretty to see but definately to be respected … He has very good percentages with his feet set … Despite the offensive reasons the real gem of McDaniels game for NBA scouts is his defense … He has outstanding efficiency numbers defending the ISO according to Synergy and he can guard 1-2-3 without any problems due to his length and quickness … He his very good of the ball as well, reading screens and situations. Thanks to his feet being in constant movement, he is really hard to post up, and this allowed Clemson to play him as a “4” in a small lineup. He is not by any mean an offensive threat but was still able to average more than 17ppg which could allow any NBA coach looking for a new “Tony Allen” to play him without risking to play 4 on 5 on the offensive hand","His biggest weakness right now is still his offensive game … His shot is getting better, particularly his 3 pointer with his feet set, but when defenders run him off the line he has a very poor pull up shooting and his decision making is highly questionable … Needs to develop a mid-range game and learn how to finish around the rim … Right now when he gets to the rim but can’t dunk, he struggles to finish, especially with his left hand … Seems to suffer a lot when defenders get into his body, which raises some questions about his attitude to fight and be strong durin a physical game … He will never need to be a great scorer, but needs to be consistent enough where he can punish the defense with open shots and precise cuts …  Ball handling also needs some work, his one on one often finish with a turnover as McDaniels often struggles to read the help … Defensively he needs to embrace the role that will be for him in the NBA, get stronger to defend stronger players, but all those are just natural developments that will occur in his career … Overall he will definitely have to struggle to find his spot in the League but without any doubt he could be the guy many coaches and GM are looking for to add athleticism and a defensive stopper on a good team …",78,196,21.39
Joe Harris,33,"One the better three-point shooters in the draft, Harris finished his four-year college career second all-time in 3-point percentage (40.7%) and 3-pointers (263) at Virginia…  His forte is the catch-and-shoot – he moves tirelessly without the ball, using screens and misdirection to get open…  While he is by no means an isolation player, Harris does have a solid handle and effectively uses ball fakes, step-backs, crossovers, and hesitations to create space for his shot or go to the hole…  Not overly flashy, but is a very effective passer – anticipates well and quickly delivers to the open man.  Averaged 3.2 assists per 40 minutes as a senior at UVA…  Not an elite athlete, but is a fairly sticky defender – always has one eye on his man and the other eye on the ball, anticipates well (again), and avoids being picked off by screens by taking proper angles…  Tough and durable – broke a bone in his left hand vs. North Carolina (2/11/12) and played the rest of that game and the last eight games of that season with protection on the hand.  Also, ranks first all-time at Virginia in games played (135)…  Has great intangibles – awareness, unselfishness, fortitude, and leadership…","Harris has below-average speed and struggles with faster opponents on both ends of the floor…  Disappears at times, offensively – because he relies heavily on off-the-ball movement to get open and is adverse to taking potentially contested outside shots, he can be neutralized by a sticky man-to-man defender or good team defense…  Not vertically explosive and has a short wingspan (6’6’’), and as a result, does not excel as a rebounder, a shot blocker, and a finisher…  Made a subpar 56.3 percent of his shots at the rim this past season, according to HoopMath.com…  Struggled from the free-throw line as a senior, making just 64 percent of his attempts.  It was the second straight season that his FT percentage dropped.  He made a career-high 77.2% as a sophomore…",78,215,22.82

Range shooting is steadier at 35%, but he shouldn’t be attempting 5 three’s per game in college. At 220 pounds (tops) with a 6’9 wingspan, defending against NBA 4’s is a bit of a pipedream … He’s bulked up some since arriving from JC – particularly core and lower body strength. More hard yards are required in order to stand firm in post defense … Tendency to get caught watching the action (when not the primary defender) is disconcerting. Awareness and focus can be suspect. Early has a plethora of skills, but a few major limitations have earned him the label of tweener … He’ll turn 23 in April putting a cap on his physical upside.

Silins can become a better on ball defender but his NBA career depends a lot on this … If he was a better athlete he would be a no brainer, but being an under the rim finisher hurts his NBA outlook … Also I would expect a former PF to have a better impact on the glass grabbing rebounds … Offensively he doesn’t move very well without the ball and needs somebody to create for him … His ball handling is good enough to survive but not take people one on one … He needs to improve his P&R as well to become a more complete player … Overall his NBA career will depend mostly on his ability to make shots and ability to not suffer too much in defense … If able to accomplish both he could find space as a role player for a team, if not he could become a really good player in Europe for many years …",81,210,20.95

According to Hoop-Math.com, 43 percent Carson’s shots came at the rim, but he converted a less-than-stellar 52 percent of those attempts …  Averaged 4 turnovers per 40 min.  The turnovers are usually due to driving out of control or lapses in attention –– he’ll occasionally have his pocket picked or have a lazy pass intercepted … His lack of height also contributes to his turnover woes, as he is easily smothered by double-teams … Greatly limited by his lack of size on the defensive side of the ball. Opposing guards can easily shoot over him or post him up … Considering his speed and quickness, he gets beat off the dribble more than you would think he would, and he often gets caught up in screens.
