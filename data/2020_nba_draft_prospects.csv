Anthony Edwards,1,"A rangy, 6’5 225 guard prospect with a truly formidable combination of size, strength and quick twitch athleticism on the perimeter … Somewhat of a physical freak, possessing an imposing frame that is mature well beyond its years and that he knows how to use to his advantage … A powerful and explosive leaper, particularly off of 2 feet, and is pretty light on his feet for his size, making him an absolute terror for defenses when he’s slashing to the rim in the half court or running the floor in transition … Is at his best when he’s going downhill, often steamrolling the wings and smaller guards that defended him on his way to the rim throughout his amateur career … Is a big-time threat to finish above the rim and through contact; has posterized his fair share of defenders and also drawn fouls at a pretty good clip in college as well (over 5 FTA a game, made a pretty solid 77%) … Has outstanding body control; seems to hang and glide in the air and rarely ever is off balance or knocked off his path due to his strong build and broad shoulders … In addition to his physical traits, Edwards has a groundwork of promising skills as a scorer, most notably a sweet looking jump shot with legit NBA range and a picturesque release that he uses to do the majority of his damage and shoots with brash confidence … Will be able to get his shots off due to the high and quick nature of his mechanics, as well as the nice elevation he rises up into his jumper with … Can create and score off the dribble as well, at times flashing the ability to pull off advanced shot creation moves that lead to impressive “good defense, better offense” shots … Has a great 1st step and also uses step back and jab step moves to create space against tight defense to get his shots when isolated … Projects to be a very tough player for defenders to contain 1 on 1 … Led the SEC in scoring and had multiple 30+ point games as a Fr., really showed he could get hot at times and light up the scoreboard in a hurry with his ability to hit perimeter shots as well as get to the rim and convert … Showed glimpses as a post up scorer as a Fr. the few times he tried against smaller guards; an impressive tool to have as a teenaged perimeter prospect, and one that could very well be useful to build on given his physical ability … Occasionally shows good timing moving without the ball as a cutter to the rim, which can lead to easy scores at the rim … Capable of blocking the occasional shot or creating a turnover by gambling in the passing lane that leads to transition opportunities … Often operated as a lead guard by necessity and to get the ball in his hands as much as possible in college, could very well see himself become much more efficient as a pro with more talent around him and less reliance on him as the sole playmaker to produce … Has the tools to be a factor on the defensive glass …","Edwards has to improve his assertiveness on both ends of the court to reach his potential, he too often bails out defenders and doesn’t utilize his physical gifts to the best of his ability on a game to game basis at this stage … There were games when it seemed like he could’ve took over and made his presence felt but instead settled for low percentage jumpers all game or showed a total disregard of playing defense … Shot selection is a work in progress … Needs to work on picking his spots offensively, if you force him off the 3 point line he can get out of control off the bounce because he lacks a real mid-range game at the moment … Should look to develop a floater and/or pull-up J from around that 12 to 15 ft area to keep defenders honest … Basketball IQ at times leaves something to be desired … Had poor defensive awareness at UGA; frequently got caught sleep at the wheel not seeing his man and the ball when matched up in the halfcourt, which allowed backdoor slips to the rim for easy layups or offensive rebounds by not locating someone to box out when the shot goes up … His team had a better defensive rating without him on the court than with, which is discouraging considering the talent jump he’s about to make in terms of the players he’ll be guarding … Given the fact that he has all the tools to be a great defender if he just works on his effort and gets a better understanding of weakside defense, there is hope for him to improve on that end …. Played heavy minutes as a lead guard with the ball in his hands, but didn’t read the floor or run his teams offense well enough to justify it … Nothing more than a mediocre passer (2.8 : 2.7 A:TO with a 130 usage rate) for a player who was projected as a combo guard in HS … Sometimes Edwards can struggle to contribute when his shots aren’t falling … Had poor efficiency (40% FG and 29% 3FG on 7 attempts a game), partly due to him taking bad shots but also due to usage and the type of extra attention he saw as a Fr … Played on a bad UGA team that was not going to make the NCAA Tournament field in 2020, which is concerning for a prospect in the running to be selected in the top half of the lottery …",77,225,19.3
James Wiseman,2,"Wiseman has physical tools that really stand out on the court, standing 7 feet with a long (7-foot-6 wingspan) and rangy frame … Considering his elite size, it is very intriguing that he brings nimble feet, agility, solid leaping ability and long strides making him an extremely promising big man on both ends of the floor … Has potential as a paint “patroller” on defense, and you have to be mindful of his location when heading to the basket or risk a weakside rejection … Has the size, range, and length to be mentioned along the lines of the top young shot-blockers in the NBA … A southpaw, he is at his best, the closer he is to the rim at the moment, and will be able to get his fair share of easy scores by running like a deer in transition for easy baskets, given the speed and athleticism advantage he will enjoy in most matchups … Looks to play above the rim, and seems like a potentially dynamic finisher as a pick/screen and roll player with his soft hands … While his time at Memphis was limited to 69 total minutes of action, teams shot only 33% when Wiseman was on the court, and he made a good amount of eye opening plays altering and blocking shots … Given his length and athletic ability, it seems likely that his defensive ability will translate to the NBA’s “defensive 3 seconds” rule, as he should be able to switch and defend more than adequately outside the paint and on switches as he gets more experience … Pretty good on the glass, especially as an offensive rebounder, and shows a quick 2nd jump … Shows a soft touch around the rim, as well as a developing turnaround jumper and decent jump hook over his right shoulder as the base of his post moves arsenal … The foundation is there for him to make some hay as a mid range shooter, he just needs more repetition, muscle memory and fundamental consistency … Has the frame to carry at least 15 more lbs of muscle without the loss of mobility …","The obvious elephant in the room is that he goes into this draft having played so few minutes of college hoops compared to other 2020 prospects, which makes him a relative unknown in just where he is in his development … While he looked incredibly strong in his first few games, the suspension followed by the decision to shut it down leaves scouts and NBA decision makers with a lot less to work with and the question of just how much his game may have tapered off had he played the entire season … He had a reputation in high school of having a motor that ran hot and cold and there were some questions that many wanted to see answered with a full season of intense play … Wiseman showed glimpses in limited action, but he also showed that he is pretty raw in his skill set and overall basketball IQ at the moment … While he is a potentially game-changing defender, he also seems to be a bit jumpy looking to send shots into the stands, and prone to fakes that lead to fouls or compromises the team’s defensive balance on the court … Whether he can be a true weapon as a scorer at the next level remains in question … He did show decent touch at times with fadaways and mid-range jumpshots … But he remains a real question mark whether he’s a guy that can create legitimate offense for himself  … He’s not very strong or physical right now, will need to put on more weight and get his lower body strength up to bang in the post with the big boys in the NBA … Shot selection can stand to improve, he seems to settle for fade-away shots and jumpers more than you expect for a guy with his physical and athletic traits … His feel for the game seems decent considering his age and development stage, but at times he does appear rushed and mechanical in the low post getting into his moves, and he needs to work on developing his back to the basket game … His ability to defend out on the perimeter is potentially very good for a big guy, but he has some things to learn fundamentally to realize it (ie playing less upright and not relying solely on his length to make up for being out of position) … Doesn’t seem to project to be an elite level shot creator in the post, which means the situation he lands in will matter that much more to his individual success because others will have to create for him, and teach him the nuances of the offensive game …",85,235,19.65
LaMelo Ball,3,"A physically gifted lead guard prospect with plenty to like in terms of his potential fit into the NBA, as he’s a rangy 6’8 perimeter player with the frame to become even more imposing as he packs on muscle … A wizard with the ball in his hands with elite ball handling and passing ability … He projects as more of a combo or point guard, but due to his frame he should easily be able to defend some SFs as he gains strength and experience, adding to his intrigue as a prospect … On top of his size, he is also a very coordinated athlete with great body control and agility … A rangy strider, Ball is also capable of playing above the rim; particularly when he has a head of steam, and he has shown the ability to leap off of one or both feet … Has the ability to be a real triple double threat on a nightly basis, in addition to his scoring and passing potential … Ball also has the size and instincts to be a factor on the glass (nearly 8 rpg in the Australian NBL in 2019) … A highly imaginative, instinctive and creative playmaker, Ball applies pressure on the defense because he has an assortment of moves in his arsenal … Adept at reading the defense while on the move, knowing when to pass or shoot … An excellent ball-handler who has a natural feel for setting up defenders with misdirection moves and change of pace dribble combos to get into the lane and create for himself and others … May be the best player in this draft at reading on-ball and help defense simultaneously when operating in pick and roll offense, and he has shown the ability to make flashy pocket passes on the move, as well as an ever-improving ability to finish through or around contact with either hand near the rim … Reads the floor well with the ball in his hands, and constantly breaks down the defense with his initial moves off the bounce … A pretty flamboyant prospect with a big persona, likes to make the highlight reel play and over time should inject excitement into the fan base of whatever team he lands on … Excellent court vision as you’d expect from a lead guard with his type of size, able to thread the needle and has been known to lead teammates to easy shots near the rim by  “passing them open” … Rewards teammates for moving without the ball (6.8 apg in the Australian NBL in 2019) … Keeps his eyes up and also does a nice job of not telegraphing what he wants to do or where he’s going to go with the ball … Does a very good job of feeding the “hot hand”, an uncommonly unselfish player for such a ballyhooed prospect … Would flourish in an up-tempo system, looks to push the ball and make splash plays in the open court as often as he can while also showing some ability to trail and hit spot up 3s … Has an effective floater already, has shown good touch as well as improved footwork and accuracy in the past 2 seasons by leaping off of 2 feet instead of 1 on his mid-range shots … Has shown some raw shot-making ability from the perimeter throughout his amateur and international career, and has frequently shown that he can put up points in bunches from all over the court … Has decent shooting touch and should continue to improve as a spot-up marksman … Very confident player, rarely ever seems in over his head or afraid of taking important shots … Has shown a few exciting flashes as a ball thief and help defender, and could even factor as a shot-blocker on the perimeter and near the rim against wings with his size, quick hands and keen anticipation … His experience playing pro ball will help his adjustment to the NBA somewhat, particularly in terms of physicality and his understanding of help defense … Also has had the benefit of being able to watch his older brother, 2017 lottery pick Lonzo Ball, and his pre-draft process as well as his early development as a professional to learn how to navigate through the rigors and grind of the draft process and ultimately NBA seasons …","His overall jump shot lacks any real consistency at the moment, and just like his older brother that can likely be attributed to his highly unorthodox shooting form … His release point is low, somewhere between his chin and his chest, and he shoots a set shot with below average elevation, leading to plenty of flat shots and bad misses whether open or contested (25% from 3point range on 6 attempts per game in 2019) … His mediocre FT shooting (72%) points to him potentially becoming a reasonably efficient shooter in time, but he’s a work in progress …. Ball’s shot selection will also need to improve, as he made just enough deep shots to both keep the defense honest, as well as justify (mostly to himself) that he should at times hoist low percentage shots off the dribble from all over the court … While a pretty good athlete, he is more smooth than dynamic and will only sporadically try to play above the rim in the half court … Should continue to add weight and strength to his improving frame, as he currently gets outmuscled by players with similar size on both ends of the court … Has some experience playing off the ball, but clearly is more effective making plays with the ball in his hands … At times can be turnover prone looking to make the home-run play when a simpler play is available … Doesn’t show any real consistent toughness or effort defensively, mostly interested in jumping passing lanes for run outs or trying to swipe for steals … Rarely stays alert or in a stance for full defensive possessions, has issues fighting through screens and may struggle to defend quicker PGs as a young pro … Seems like the type of player who will be asked to defend the other team’s worst perimeter scorer as he develops, but his defensive versatility (and effectiveness) could improve as he gets stronger and shows more awareness, largely due to his physical tools … There have been whispers that some teams may see Ball’s more nonchalant approach as a player as a questionable investment for a potential franchise player and top draft choice, though his improvement over the past few years seems to point to a determined, hard working young player …",78,180,19.25
Patrick Williams,4,"An explosive, “freakish” combo forward with intriguing upside, especially as a defender … One of the most explosive athletes in college basketball, Williams is difficult to keep off of the offensive glass … Oozes potential with his eye popping physical profile and standout versatility … Scores a fair amount of baskets just through sheer athleticism as he’s able to physically outclass most players at the college level … Excellent length with a 6’11 wingspan … Very strong legs and powerful frame. When he’s engaged, he plays a physical brand of basketball and should only get stronger as his body develops with age … Ability to defend multiple positions gives him added intrigue … Converts a number of tip dunks as well as ally oops … Really efficient in the role of an off ball defender, but also effective on the ball … Has amazing speed to make up ground and intercept passes, as evidenced by his steal per game … Intriguing versatility with his ability to handle the ball and knock down mid-range jumpers … Averaged 83.8% from the FT line, an encouraging stat regarding his ability to develop into a high level face the basket scorer … His 32% from three is impressive when you consider his form and combine that with his potential to create shots … Blocked 30 shots on the year, one per game, showing an impressive ability to react and erase shots for a 6’8 forward … 4 rebounds per game, made more impressive when you consider he played in just 22 minutes per game … Shows a solid ability to cut off drives and pull up for jump shots with efficiency … Phenomenal hand strength, showing the ability to corral the ball very easily with one hand … Shows tons of untapped potential. One of the youngest prospects in the 2020 draft. Turned 19 on August 26th giving him a lot more upside and time to develop than his peers in this draft class … Shows excellent versatility with the ability to handle and pass … Displays the ability to create for others with his vision and passing skills … Has a chance to be one of the top players to come out of the 2020 draft …","There are question marks about his want to as a scorer, and his ceiling as a scorer at the next level … Can he be a 15+ point scorer, does he have the desire to be a bucket getter? … Does not seem to have the instinct to be a high level scorer. So being a standout role player type could be his calling … Doesn’t have the most impressive body of work from a statistical standpoint … Only averaged 9.2 points per game as a freshman … Struggled for playing time in his freshman year, (22 mpg) despite relative effectiveness … Shot just 32% from three, on 16 makes throughout the year … Has a great reputation for being a nice kid, but at times has been called “too nice” and in need of more grit in order to maximize his abilities … Should look to utilize his physicality to his advantage more often … Needs to work on back to the basket skills … Improve his footwork and learn some post moves … Plays unselfish to a fault. Can learn to play with more sense of urgency and force the issue, considering his talent edge … Shows tons of untapped potential, but whether he will be able to tap that ability is the question mark. How badly does he “want it”? … He likely will be a player that really benefits from a good development situation at the next level, or may not make it with his first team if he lands in the wrong situation … Jump shot is a little slow and mechanical. Will need to work on speeding up his release some, specifically from deep … Appears to have better form when shooting pull ups than spot ups … Seems to shoot a jumpshot from mid-range and a set shot from deep. Perhaps learning to get more of a streamline form from deep would increase his shot release quickness and efficiency …",79,215,19.24
Isaac Okoro,5,"Fits the prototype physically of an NBA small forward with his 6’6 220 lb frame and strong athletic ability, and he uses his size well to compliment his playing style … A good finisher at the rim off 1 or both feet, and is able to convert through contact and with either hand effectively …  Has decent length for a wing with a 6’8.5 wingspan and 8’4.5 standing reach … Flashes good touch to complete plays around the rim on drives when he’s unable to score on dunks … Capable of highlight finishes where he utilizes his great explosiveness and strength to power through contact … Has a lot of composure and confidence for a freshman, and looks the part as a no nonsense future pro, with focus and determination … A slasher with the ball in his hands, shows good body control, strength and has enough juice in his 1st step off the dribble to get in the lane with effectiveness in the NBA … Seems to be a high IQ player, generally plays to his strengths on both ends and doesn’t make a ton of risky decisions … Moves well without the ball, actively looking to cut and score easy points on the weakside … Only 19 years old and already is a pretty promising defender due to his sound fundamentals and active feet … Flashes good timing coming up with help side blocks, and also is pretty good at rotating to take charges as well … Is able to defend on the wing and switch to defend against some small ball 4s, doing an great job of containing dribble penetration even against quicker and athletic players in college…Has the frame to be able to work through screens off the ball…Willing passer and an unselfish player…Solid player, the type who will handle his role with a workmanlike approach, possesses winning traits and doesn’t appear to be “high maintenance” … Born in late January of 2001, he’s one of the younger prospects in this year’s draft …","Okoro is a work in progress when it comes to his skill level offensively … Is more effective the closer he is to the rim, and shot a below average 28% from 3 in his Fr season … While his touch is good, his mechanics are inconsistent as he is often affected by closeouts and contests … Will be made to prove that he can be a threat and hit open shots from 3 point range, and his upside and offensive value with coincide with his ability to improve his jumper … His mid-range game is poor at the moment, becomes ineffective when his initial driving lanes are cut off … Sometimes is apprehensive about shooting even when there is room, passing up shots or driving into the defense for lower percentage shots … Also struggles from the FT line for a wing prospect, shooting a mediocre 67% in 2019-2020 … Doesn’t have much creativity to his Isolation game, more of a straight line slasher who becomes less effective/more turnover prone the more he dribbles … Somewhat rudimentary as a ball-handler in the half court, though he showed a willingness to create when called upon … He often got stripped by off the ball defenders when he attempted multiple moves in isolation … Just decent as a shot blocker and ball thief; seems to prefer to work as a solid, lower risk team defender as opposed to a gambling, playmaking defender … There is optimism that he can develop into a “Swiss Army knife” type of player, but there is work to be done on all levels of his offensive repertoire to fulfill that potential as he doesn’t have any standout skills, aside from athleticism, on that end of the court just yet … Was showing signs of becoming a star but still more of a complimentary guy in his first year at Auburn, can he be a star at the NBA level, he’s likely to be drafted with that in mind based on draft projections, though he had not reached that level in college … if he’s able to tone his frame, could gain additional speed and quickness …",78,215,19.82
Onyeka Okongwu,6,"Exceptional rim protector who can block shots in one-on-one match ups or erase looks in well-timed help defense … Relatively undersized NBA big man with great length to make up for his lack of height …Physical player in the post who uses his strength to get and keep good positioning down in the paint … Finishes with both hands in the paint and is comfortable moving to either side … Tremendous athleticism with spin moves down low or quick first step in the paint … Always seems to get to the rim without settling for jumpers … Just like Harrell, Okongwu is elite in the pick and roll game as he moves extremely effectively without the ball … Length and vertical set him apart as a great rebounder, particularly on the offensive glass … Gets to the line often and shoots efficiently at 74%, a promising sign for his offensive development  … Excellent FG shooting percentage at 61% … Stays out of foul trouble for the most part … Reads passes well with over a steal per game … All-around elite defender both inside and outside the paint … Off ball movement is what sets him apart from other big men in the conference … One of the highest potential players in the entire 2020 NBA Draft due to his elite play on both sides of the ball and great rebounding ability","Must polish his offensive game as he can at times be too reliant upon his physical gifts in order to overpower and outclass opponents at the college level … Often relies on second chance opportunities after missing his first shot … Seems to be a little out of control at times in the paint … Underdeveloped outside shooting acumen will make him easier to stop at the next level initially … Loses track of fundamentals at points and releases hook shots too low … It’s questionable how effective he will be playing as a stretch four due to poor outside shooting making him a one-dimensional offensive player … While it is uncommon, he sometimes gets blown by but makes up for it with blocks from behind; something that may not work with faster, more physical/explosive NBA players … Poor ball-handling impacts limits his ability to create offense as a jump shooter …",81,235,19.95

be most comfortable and effective with the ball in his hands, is a natural creator … Loves to attack in isolation or when the defense isn’t set, very good in the open court and has the aggressiveness and ball-handling to create on the fly and apply pressure on the defense … Good, strong 1st step off the bounce … One of the best in the 2020 draft class at making difficult shots, which is both a blessing and a curse … Has shown that he has good touch, and the groundwork is there for him to become an efficient mid-range player due to his promising pull-up and step back jumpers, and a few effective floaters that he already has in his bag … Can finish with either hand and has the ability to make difficult lay-ins around the rim at times against tough defense … When he decides to go in playmaker mode, he occasionally shows adequate passing skills and the ability to make the right play when the defense is breaking down … Contributes defensively and on the glass, nearly 6 rpg (5.7) as a Fr. and has the potential to be a pretty good defender with more experience, as he should be able to guard his position and the 2-guard spot depending on the matchup … Has the type of sturdy base, strength, toughness and athleticism to contain dribble penetration from most guards, and he strung together some strong possessions and made a few timely steals that turned into points for UNC as a Fr that illustrates his potential on that end … Doesn’t shy away from contact, will only fare better dealing with physicality as he gets older … Made a few impressive help side blocks this season, indicating both sound instincts and athleticism … Strong bloodlines, his father, Greg, was a college star at UNLV and played 11 seasons in the NBA at PG … Solid physical profile for a point guard at 6’3 in shoes and possessing a 6’4.5 wingspan …","Anthony will need to develop his ability to be an efficient team player to reach his full potential and optimal value in the league … There’s a concern that if he’s not talented enough to be effective as a team leader (standout), he may struggle to contribute … Borders on overconfident at times … Got in the bad habit of over-penetrating and throwing up wild contested shots, attempting to draw fouls and often ended up being well contested misses … While he has the talent to impress, he at times struggles with his shot selection (38% FG) and general decision-making (4 apg to 3.5 topg) … Shot just 75% from the free throw line in his freshman year, down considerably from his near 90% in high school … Can be a bit sloppy with the ball in stretches, forcing the action and over dribbling to cause turnovers, and isn’t quite a natural playmaker for others or a true floor general from the lead guard spot …  It seems to take a concerted effort for him to pass, only sporadically scoring and setting up teammates well in the same game … UNC didn’t have much spacing or shooting, but Anthony did miss some chances to make passes to open teammates, especially off the dribble, often settling for more difficult shots than necessary … Put together some strong scoring performances, but also struggled against the stronger teams that UNC faced in the ACC slate … Teams will want to get a better gauge on his deep shooting skills, as he shot with confidence and had a good reputation as a prep player, but was a lackluster 34% from downtown as a Freshman and it may take time for him to consistently knock down shots from NBA range … Shooting release is somewhat slow and he isn’t a knockdown shooter against closeouts even with his feet set, though he isn’t someone to just leave open and dare to shoot … Has good defensive potential, but still is green and will gamble or put himself in bad positions, sometimes by defending screens incorrectly (going underneath when a good shooter has the ball, staying tight when a non shooter has it, etc)…Some teams will question if Anthony projects more as a franchise player or as a contributing scoring option, some may be high on his upside as a scoring guard while others may point to his scoring acumen and work-in-progress decision making skills as the main reason that he isn’t a lead guard … Has the swagger and confidence of a high school and college star, but may be in for a rude awakening at the next level as he may have to fight through considerable adversity to figure out how to utilize his skills and be an NBA contributor … Though his team was decimated with injuries and not really constructed well, he will have to attempt to explain why a typical powerhouse like UNC struggled so much with him there as a ballyhooed recruit, even after he returned after missing a month with a knee injury … Will be 20 years old as an NBA rookie, making him slightly older than most of the Fr in his class …",75,185,20.53

Udoka Azubuike,27,"Udoka Azubuike’s most obvious strength is pretty hard to miss. He is very big. At 7 feet .25 inches in shoes, and possessing an elite 7’7” wingspan he’s extremely long. Even better, after years in the weight room he’s molded himself into a lean, muscular 260 pound athlete. Dok can hold his own with the biggest and strongest of NBA centers. His size and length give him immediate translatable skills like rebounding and the ability to defend the rim. Azubuike isn’t a stiff either. At the 2020 combine he measured a freakish 37 inch max standing vertical leap, which allowed him to hit the 12’6” mark without any sort of run. After averaging 2.6 blocks per game as a senior at Kansas, Udoka’s size and spring will render him at the very least a plus rim defender in the NBA with the potential to be elite. While not the quickest lateral player his 7’7” wingspan also makes him extremely effective guarding the entire paint area, and extremely effective in one on one post matchups, help and rotational situations in the lane. Even in a more spaced out environment, he would be a major deterrent for offensive players to test their luck in the paint. While not a guy you really want running around by the 3 point line, he’s developed into a solid pick and roll defender too with the ability to effectively switch and stay out of foul trouble. Dok truly was a historic figure in NCAA D1 Hoops. Over four seasons at Kansas he shot .7465% from the field, good for first all time. No, Azubuike isn’t going to impress you with a vast array of post moves, but he is an extremely effective finisher, with the length and girth to be a high level pick and roll target and finisher at the rim at the NBA level. Chances are if he gets the ball in the low post, he’s going to score. Dok upped his rebounding every season at Kansas, and his 10.5 rebounds per game as a senior (3.5 offensive) are good indicators that he’ll be able to collect misses at a good clip at the next level. Over four years he really transformed his body. Dok lost fat, gained muscle and athleticism, and improved endurance which really aided in being in the position to be talked about entering the NBA draft. While not your typical face up big man of 2020, Dok is good enough at what he does (and good enough to be able to do it in the NBA) to be looked at as a potential draft pick or two way player. After seeing how unpolished he was 4 years ago, it’s a testament to his work ethic, which is also another strength","In 1992 we might be talking about a player like Azubuike being picked up in the lottery, but with the way the game has changed, despite being elite as a rebounder, and rim defender, those characteristics don’t hold nearly as much value if you’re not able to stretch the floor for better spacing. No doubt Dok is more comfortable as an offensive player than he was as a freshman, but he’s never really developed the ability to hit a face up jump shot. This makes his only value on offense strictly around the rim. His projected failure to draw his defender away from the hoop will allow defenses to sag off and contend the rim easier. His lack of improvement as a free throw shooter doesn’t exactly paint a trajectory of developing even a consistent 15 footer over the next few years. Udoka shot just 44% from the free throw stripe as a senior, and that was a career high. He is also not a naturally quick lateral defender. His focus on conditioning has certainly allowed him to improve, but guarding face up bigs one on one in the NBA often 20-25 feet away from the basket could make him an easier target to blow past, or exploit by a stretch 5 with three point range.",83,260,21.19

Will have questions about his attitude on the court, displayed poor body language and often seen sulking when things didn’t go his way … Possibly even more troubling, McDaniels picked up 5 technical fouls in his Fr season, which is only compounded by the fact that a “tech” in college is also both a personal and team foul … A headlining recruit for a young Washington team, but their season was a big disappointment relative to preseason expectations this past season …",82,200,20.15

Desmond Bane,30,"Has something very valuable in today’s NBA landscape, and that is high level shooting. As a senior, Bane nailed 42% of his three point attempts, and posted a 3 point percentage over 40% in 3 full NCAA seasons. Bane has excellent range on his jumper, and great in spot up situations as well as shooting off the dribble. He’d be an immediate asset to an NBA team spacing the floor at the two spot. At 6’6” Bane possesses a chiseled frame, and high level strength that will be able to handle the rigors of an NBA season, and larger opponents. His 16.6 points as a senior were primarily earned from the perimeter, but Desmond does have the ability to get into the lane and is very good at using his powerful body to take impact and create distance from opposing shot blockers. Nice touch around the rim, and solid ability to adjust in mid air while getting to the hoop. A smart player who had to become more of a distributor during his senior season. He averaged 3.9 assists per game, and was very good at making the “right” pass, and even showed a little bit of ability to run a pick and roll. At 6’6” he was a very good rebounding guard at the college level hauling in 6.3 boards per contest and even notching 4 double doubles with points and rebounds. Defensively he puts in the work, and while not projected as an elite NBA defender, he could do well in a team scheme. He has active hands and stole the ball 1.5 times per game, and is a good vertical athlete who can contest shots.","While Desmond Bane is tall, strong, and a good vertical athlete he’s not really the total package in terms of physicality. Despite being 6’6” tall, he only has a 6’4.25” wingspan, which makes him one of the few players at this level of basketball to have a wingspan shorter than their height. This limits his defensive potential a bit in the NBA. Again, Bane can get off the ground, but lateral quickness isn’t something that is a strong suit for him. He puts forth tons of effort on the court, which will help him, but when trying to get in the lane off the dribble, or trying to guard a quick player, it’s just going to be harder at the NBA level for someone who’s not naturally quick, or particularly fast at changing directions. Does not really project as an NBA player with a lot of positional versatility. Is likely to play the shooting guard on offense, and guard the shooting guard on defense, with maybe a small portion of small forwards. NBA point guards could likely be too quick for him, and a large portion of small forwards could prove to be too long.

Granted ball skills and shooting are more important long term for point guards than athleticism (ie Curry vs Westbrook) … Struggles some to finish plays around the rim due to his lack of leg strength and explosiveness … NBA readiness and ability to contribute immediately are both concerns as he’s extremely thin, even by college standards … Assist to turnover number was underwhelming and needs to improve (3.2 to 2.6) … Additional core strength should improve his leaping ability, but also his explosiveness off the dribble … Most of Terry’s offense came in pick and roll and spot ups and he rarely created off of isolation … Becoming better at working in space on isolation will be beneficial to him …",75,170,20.15

His first step is surprising for a guy his size … Looked impressive shooting from the perimeter, ended up at 36% from three and his percentage was higher for much of the season … Form on his shot is solid, though slightly mechanical, but he should be able to extend it out to NBA 3 in time and find success … Utilizes a solid turnaround jumper when he receives the ball back to the basket … Was highly effective as a mid-range jump shooter, which is a skill that will translate exquisitely to the next level … Also proved to be a force on the defensive end with 2.5 blocks per game … Solid shot blocker showing good timing, and the length and explosiveness to block shots, both on the ball and as a help defender … Runs the floor well. Gets out on the break and can ignite the break playing the passing lanes with excellent anticipation and quick feet and reflexes for a bigman … Shows very good rebounding ability, especially on the offensive glass where he averaged nearly 4 per game (3.7) and 11 rebounds overall … Excellent hands, showing the ability to catch passes without having many mishaps and the ball seems to stick to his hands on rebounds or passes that aren’t completely on line … Appears to be just scratching the surface of his abilities, as a 20 year old (21 in October) with a lot of skill level yet to polish … Highly coachable, and seems to do a very good job of working on his weaknesses and in game mistakes in order to improve …","Has solid weight at 240 lbs, but could stand to add more muscle to his frame, in particular his upper body  … Not the most fluid of athletes. Slightly mechanical in his movement and also his jumpshot … Doesn’t have the strength and explosiveness to power through contact and finish and generally looks to avoid contact when attacking the basket … While he shot impressively from behind the arch, for most of his sophomore year, his volume of shots (19-of-52, 0.6 makes per game) creates some skepticism about whether he can shoot from range consistently and extend out to NBA three. But the promise is there … Shooting motion lacks fluidity and takes a little while to go from catching to releasing … Should look to eliminate wasted motion in his shooting form … Shot just 70% from the FT line in his sophomore year … Not the most physical player, has decent body strength but could stand to add more muscle which would allow him to seek out contact more consistently … Can improve upon his pick and roll game, developing better ability to screen and pop or roll … Solid athletically, but not a spectacular leaper, especially off one foot … A little bit of a two footed dominant jumper, which at his size and length isn’t a huge deal, however he is a little less effective in transition as he tends to gather himself before exploding which can be the split second difference between a made basket and a missed one … Some further leg training should give him better explosiveness to go off one foot and finish drives more effortlessly … May struggle to score around the basket with his limited explosiveness … Still learning what he’s capable in isolation situations on the perimeter. Showed a tendency to turn the ball over on traveling violations involving his feet moving faster than his decision to put the ball on the floor … May take some time to adjust to the level of play at the next level as a lot of his success came through sheer outclassing opponents with his size and athleticism. However, his skill set should allow him to transition to the NBA over time …",82,240,21.18

Xavier Tillman,35,"Tillman emerged as one of the best and most dominant big men in the entire Big Ten over the course of his last two seasons in East Lansing … His touch around the rim and rebounding dominance helped earn him All-Big Ten honors in his final season … He is also a gifted defender with great discipline, strength, and anticipation. His 1.2 steals and 2.1 blocks per game awarded him the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in his junior year. His impact on defense went far beyond the stats as he anchored one of the conference’s best defenses with leadership and inspiration … One of those guys that can unite and motivate a team with vocal leadership and leading by example … Excellent court vision for a big man with three assists per game and only two turnovers, rarely from bad passes … He was able to dominate in the post in college with a great hook shot and efficient scoring (58% FG for his career) … While he did not shoot a high percentage, he showed that he could potentially develop an outside shooting game in his final season. If he can threaten from the perimeter at some point in his career, he will be a valuable asset for any team … The southpaw is relentless and never stops fighting for rebounds; a major reason why he averaged a double-double despite only being 6’8 in a conference with giants like Luka Garza, Daniel Oturu, and Kofi Cockburn … This relentless effort will help him at the next level as team are always looking for players who will be ready to contribute right away after a short offseason","Tillman is very undersized for a player who hangs out mostly in the post. At only 6’8, he will be at a severe disadvantage. He also is not athletically gifted enough to make up for it with leaping ability. His rebounding solely depends on high effort and positioning, which may not be enough at the next level … He is showing promise that he could eventually spread the floor with a perimeter jumper, but until then he will just clog the paint and prevent guards from being able to drive … Tillman is also one of the older players (22 just after the start of the season) in the draft having played three years of college ball at Michigan State … Does not have a great repertoire of post moves and does not threaten too much with a post fadeaway … Jump shooting will make or break Tillman’s career. If he cannot develop a perimeter shooting game or even a mid-range game, he will struggle to earn impactful playing time despite his passing ability and high motor",81,265,21.87

Saben Lee,38,"Lee was a prolific scorer at Vanderbilt, especially when fellow star Aaron Nesmith went down with an injury last season. Lee took over the Commodores offense with an average of 18.6 points per game as a junior … He is an explosive player who gets to the rim at will and finishes well when he gets there. His slashing ability and playmaking are his greatest strengths as he tries to improve his perimeter shooting game … Lee averaged over four assists per game in his final season and got to the line over six times per game in his final two seasons. He improved from 67% to 75% in these attempts from the line in his final season … He is a fierce defender who averaged at least a steal per game in all three seasons at Vanderbilt. His 6’9 wingspan at only 6’2 is very enticing and combined with his speed and quickness, he looks to be a nightmare to guard on the ball and to go up against as the on-ball defender … Lee shot 55% on two-point shots as a junior showing how great he is around the rim, especially with his massive volume with 13 shots per game … Great ball-handling and quick twitches also make Lee formidable in isolations … Lee is one of the more interesting players in his class because of his long wingspan and great explosiveness. His mix of size and speed will make him a rookie to watch with such a high ceiling.","While Lee has great measurements and athleticism, his jump shot is just as unusual as his long wingspan on a small body. He shot only 33% in his three-year career and his shooting form is very unorthodox. He will certainly be a project and will have to rely on his slashing ability to make up for a lack of a jump shot early on in his career … Lee handled the ball a lot in his final season, but three turnovers per game is also hard to look past. He will have to take better care of the ball at the next level in order to get meaningful minutes … Off-ball defending became an issue a little too often and will have to improve rather quickly in his career … Lee has the quickness, but strength will be a major question mark. He will need to be able to fight through harder screens and go up with taller, stronger defenders on these drives that he was so effective with in college. He could get pushed around much more than he was at Vandy with a short off-season and less time to bulk up with a true, professional workout regimen.",74,175,21.42

While he has the range, his tendency to launch shots 5 feet beyond the line raises some question marks … Appears that he could tone his body some … Can be over ambitions with his passing at times, trying to thread a needle or look for the spectacular play …",78,230,22.71
Robert Woodard,40,"Woodard made a name for himself in the SEC as a defensive force both on the perimeter and in the post … He averaged both a steal and a block per game as a sophomore, but his effect and impact went far beyond the stat sheet … He has a 7’2 wingspan which allows him to be disruptive on handoffs and elevate at the rim with taller big men … Woodard also improved immensely from year one to year two in Starkville. He improved his three-point shooting from 27% to 43% and averaged over 11 points per game for the Bulldogs … Woodard also improved driving to the basket. He has great bounce and showed it on some powerful dunks. He also uses this bounce effectively to hang in the air longer and maneuver his body around defenders while still in the air. This allows him to have great finishing above and around the rim … He also showed smart and effective movement off the ball allowing him to get some easy buckets at the rim … He positions himself well in the post and gets up for rebounds as he averaged over six per game in 33 minutes per contest … His aggressive defensive playstyle did not lead to many fouls with an average of under two fouls per game … He looked much more comfortable from beyond the arc in his second season and was very effective as a spot up shooter … He also looked sharper with his pull-up jumper and showed potential with his mid-range shooting … Woodard’s best trait is undoubtedly his hustle and his effort. He was the heartbeat of the Bulldogs squad and this high work ethic will allow him to find a spot on a team and work his way up. While he may not be drafted, he will not disappear and will almost certainly get a chance somewhere because of this determination …","Woodard makes up for a lot of his weaknesses with his hard work and hustle but there are still some glaring weaknesses in his game … He is only 6’7 so he needs to have much better ball-handling than he does right now … This poor ball-handling eliminates any possibility for him to be a facilitator or a shot creator. He struggles to get open on his own and he requires a lot of space to make three pointers because of his very slow, Draymond Green-like release. He improved his three-point shooting but it came at a cost as he needs his lower body to squat down and release his shot slowly. He will need to increase the speed of his jumper if he is going to have any success … He will have to play as a rebounding, defending power forward with the potential to spread the floor if he can make his jump shot faster. Again, because of his size this will be a tough transition going up against much larger and stronger NBA forwards … His free-throw shooting is also a cause for concern. He shot only 58% as a freshman and 64% as a sophomore … He is not outstanding in anything that he does, outside of his hustle and effort.

Naji Marshall,-1,"Marshall was at his best at Xavier with the ball in his hands trying to make plays with his speed and athleticism. He is listed at 6’7 but he plays more like a point guard and has the speed to beat smaller guards off the dribble. He is an accurate passer and a good facilitator, but sometimes gets caught in the air and makes the wrong pass … As mentioned before, his best traits are his speed and athleticism. He scores most of his points around the rim and he does so with good ball-handling and body control … With a wingspan of 7’0 he is able to wrap around taller defenders to get passes off and avoid blocked shots … Marshall is a great defender with size and quickness to guard any position other than the center … His length allows him to dominate on the glass when he is up against guards and helps him take the ball away (1.3 steals per game as a junior) … Marshall can be used as a slashing playmaker as well as a strong defender early on in his career. He is comfortable with the ball in his hands and can give traditional point guards a break at any time … His four assists per game were very impressive for someone with his size … High motor player who hustles for loose rebounds and plays with high energy almost all of the time … He is an average free throw shooter at 72.5% for his career and shot a good percentage from two-point range (53.5%) despite a high volume (8.8 two-point attempts per game) … There is no real downside to his defensive game. He is successful against both small guards and lanky big men and essentially everything in between. He is tough to drive past and even more difficult to elevate over because of his vertical and length. Can make a real impact off the bench as a lockdown defender","Marshall struggled from distance with a 29% career percentage. Some of this can be attributed to high volume, but his struggles were a major storyline and easy to focus in on. If he cannot improve on this, teams will be able to take away his slashing ability on pick and rolls by allowing him to take deep threes … He also turned the ball over way too much with nearly 3.5 turnovers per game in his last two seasons. With limited playing time at the next level, he will not be able to afford this high turnover rate … He also found himself in foul trouble quite often due to his aggressive play style on the defensive end and getting out of control on his dribble drives … Marshall also struggled with shots outside of the paint. If he was denied a lane all the way to the rim, he struggled with pull up jumpers and floaters in the lane.

While he only had 45 three-point attempts, he knocked down nearly half of them (22) and it allowed him to attack the basket more as well … Childs is athletic enough to drive to the basket, but he is at his best in post-ups where he can use his strength to get close to the basket and finish with touch around the rim … He is listed at 6’7, 225 pounds, but with a big wingspan and standing reach, he plays much taller and stronger … He has great post moves and a wide variety of shot fakes that keep defenders off balanced … He is effective in both the pick and roll and pick and pop game. He has a good enough jumper to get to a spot and knock down shots and also athletic enough to get to the hoop after a strong screen … He is a dominant rebounder because of his great positioning and athleticism to elevate above his opponents … He averaged two offensive rebounds per game in all four of his seasons … Two assists per game is respectable for a big man who primarily plays in the post, so he sees the court rather well … On the defensive end, he is tough to back down because of his strength and footwork … He is a true, dominant scorer and he does it in a number of ways … Although his post hook is most lethal, Childs also developed a bit of a post fadeaway that will only improve with increased practice … He looked a lot more comfortable from three-point range thanks to better shot selection and decreased volume from his junior year … He averaged more points in 2019-20 despite less minutes thanks to terrific playmakers around him in TJ Haws and Jake Toolson … He has a well-rounded game for a non-power five big man and it allowed him to dominate lesser competition … His athleticism and strength will allow him to compete against larger big men at the next level and he should not be overlooked as a late second round draft pick","Childs did work in a three-point jumper to his game, but it is also very slow like Joel Embiid … He averaged over two turnovers per game in his last three seasons for the Cougars … Free throw percentage is not promising as he dropped from 71% as a junior to 54% as a senior … Foul trouble seemed to be a consistent issue with over two and a half fouls per game in only 28 minutes per game … While he has athleticism and strength mentioned above, it is never ideal to be a 6’8 big man. He will be able to compete better than most 6’8 bigs, but it will be tough playing with such a size disadvantage when most of his time is spent in the post … He has improved drastically with his jumper, but he still lacks a mid-range shooting game. He is not a good enough ball handler to create these shots on his own and he often relies on spot-up shooting when he is not in the post … His play style benefits from being the star player and being put in positions to dominate. He will struggle to make an impact when every play is not drawn up for him …. Childs has great potential but is more of a project to developing shot creating ability and at the age of 22, he is already behind on the development process",79,225,22.86

He shot over 40% from distance on nearly five attempts per game … Fitts is also fast and enough and quick enough to drive by players with similar size to him and finish with power at the rim … His length allows him to strip the ball on drives and it resulted in 1.4 steals per game putting him top five in the conference in that category … Another strength of Fitts’ game is his leaping ability, which allowed him to grab seven rebounds per game in each of his two seasons for the Gaels … He also shoots very well from the line for someone of his size at 80% … Simply put, Fitts is, and plays like, a truck. He runs around the court at full speed and makes plays consistently … He and Jordan Ford combined for the first 34 points in a conference championship game against Gonzaga showing that he is capable of taking over and leading a team if he is needed … Fitts is a freak athlete with an ability to shoot on the perimeter and control the post because of his strength … He can develop into a regular starter in a few years because of this and if he can refine other parts of his game as well, he may just be one of the steals of this draft.","The major weaknesses in Fitts’ game are his defense against smaller players and his decision making. He turned the ball over twice per game and if you include poor shot selection, that number will skyrocket. He put a lot of pressure on himself to carry the team and it led to poor shot selection and reckless drives putting him in foul trouble. He needs to play more under control and stay patient on the offensive end if he is going to take advantage of fewer play time … Fitts is quick, but he struggled on the perimeter against smaller, faster guards. He is not the worst mismatch in pick-and-roll switches, but there is no doubt he has trouble in these situations … He is powerful and quick on the dribble drive, but he often forces this style of play and it leads to foul trouble and tough shots … He only averaged an assist per game last year and given the reliance on him and his ability to drive, this number should have been higher … If he can improve his court vision and make smart passes, he will develop into a great role player and eventually a good starting stretch-four.",80,230,23.39

Khalil Whitney,-1,6’6 athletic forward … Good size and length with a 7’0 wingspan … High-level athlete and one of the best in his class. Quick off the ground and finishes well above the rim.

Tends to score the majority of his points off threes and dunks.

Can improve creating, half-court offense, and playing off the ball … Can improve finishing in traffic and when he doesn’t dunk … Can improve as a ball handler and picks up his dribble early, which are some things he could improve upon to help him as a slasher. Gets loose with the ball and can protect it better on drives. Telegraphs passes and needs work reading the defense. Averaged 4.2 turnovers per game over the Nike EYBL in 2018 …",79,205,19.87
