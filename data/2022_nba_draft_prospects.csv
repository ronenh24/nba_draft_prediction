Paolo Banchero,1,"Has good size and length for his position, standing 6’10”, 250 lbs … Has a good blend of strength and athleticism / fluidity … Moves well with and without the ball … Solid all-around player that can do a bit of everything … Stand out at creating shots for a player his size … Has a rare mix of moves for a big man – is comfortable crossing his defender up, making spin moves, and is able to remain on balance when attacking off the bounce … Excellent body control, and uses the body well to shield the ball from defenders on his shot attempts … Shot 33.8% from three during his year at Duke and projects to be able to make the NBA three with consistency due to solid mechanics and fluidity in his jumpshot. Is able to shoot off the catch or create for himself off the bounce … Is especially dangerous as a trail man where he can shoot the three or attack a late closeout from a defender … Possesses excellent footwork, especially in the post, that allows him to remain on balance and create advantages for himself by getting defenders out of position … Can score in a variety of ways in the post … Has a fadeaway jumper that is extremely difficult to contest, and can hit it with regularity … Uses his strength to power through contact and scores despite being fouled regularly … Can play above the rim and likes to finish plays with dunks instead of layups … Is not a selfish player, averaging 3.2 assists per game for his college career … Is comfortable playing as a roller or popping out looking for a jumper or driving lane when playing the pick and roll game … There really isn’t much he can’t do on the offensive end of the court. Is an instinctive player who reacts quickly and naturally to what opponents throw at him … What he lacks for in run/jump athleticism, he makes up for with dexterity, coordination, body control and great feel for the game …","For all of his offensive gifts, still has room to improve defensively snd may never be better than decent on the defensive end … lacks later quickness to defend on the perimeter … He doesn’t provide much rim protection, averaging less than a block per game … Will likely need to play center at the pro level, at least defensively to compensate for his lack of lateral quickness … He can struggle with turnovers, as he had 4 or more in 11 of his 39 games at Duke … Would like to see him shoot a bit higher than 72.9% from the free throw line … His outside shot can be streaky, which is good when it’s hitting, but not so much when he misses a couple early …",82,250,19.62
Chet Holmgren,2,"Extremely skilled frontcourt player who can initiate offense at every level of the floor … Has shown flashes of going coast-to-coast in the open floor, taking his defender off the dribble and getting to the rim before the opposing defense gets set … Great size (7-1) and long arms (7-6 wingspan) allow him to alter and/or block just about every shot taken in his vicinity … Elite interior defender in college who makes up for his lack of strength with length and tremendous timing in the post, though he’ll need strength to not get pushed around… Fluid shot motion and quick trigger allow him to dominate in the pick-and-pop game whenever his shot is on … Shot 39% on the season from beyond the arc, including 45% from early December until the NCAA Tournament … Can play both on and off the ball on the offensive end by attacking less mobile centers and generating space in the half-court offense with the threat of his outside jumper … Can attack opponents off the dribble and make bigger defenders pay who close out aggressively. His quick trigger and ability to put the ball on the floor make it nearly impossible to defend him fading away off screens. Long strides allow him to get from the perimeter to the rim with only one dribble and a spin … Generational talent who is bound to fill up a highlight reel every time he plays … Tremendous lateral footwork that allows him to defend 1-5 and alter almost any shot on the floor … Can pass with his back to the basket in the post and sitting at the top of the key reading off-ball movement … Decent rebounder who can get out and run any time he brings down a defensive board … Has the ball-handling and speed to lead the break in transition immediately after pulling down a rebound … Sky high  potential due to his measurements and skill set at only 20-years-old. Could become an Anthony Davis type of two way dominant player if he can fill out his frame and stretch his range while remaining consistent from beyond the arc … Impressive basketball feel and IQ for a young bigman. He can become a special NBA  player if his body develops and he can stay injury free …","Lack of physical strength (195 lbs) remains his biggest hurdle. Whether or not he can add significant weight and maintain his agility and mobility is a big question mark … While his combination of length and agility is extremely rare, it’s hard to imagine him being able to play on the perimeter as a facilitator as his size will eventually slow him down with time and age … Without better body strength, durability is a factor … More physical players can bully him under the rim and take away his length by getting him out of position and also attack him as long as they keep their dribble and put him into these difficult positions … Doesn’t get fully engaged on screens and shies away from contact, which limits the amount of separation his ball-handlers can get in this action … Struggles to stay out of foul trouble with nearly 4 fouls per 40 minutes in only season at Gonzaga … Didn’t put up great numbers against elite competition and disappeared for large periods at a time in these big games … 71% from the Ft line gives some pause to the idea that he’s an elite shooter … Appears that he can be an 80% FT shooter in the NBA due to his form and touch, but his college numbers did not prove that … Impressive shooting numbers from three giving him obvious intrigue as a perimeter scorer, but he did hit just 41 threes on the year and 1.3 per game (a low volume) and against a lower caliber of opponents playing in the WCC …",84,195,20.16
Jabari Smith,3,"Wiry 6’10 combo / stretch four with long arms that allow him to shoot over defenders and be effective at all three levels … Among the best pull-up jump shooters in the country, particularly from beyond the arc and just inside the arc. 44% three-point shooter on over 5 attempts per game through 17 games … Has the length and size to elevate above most defenders and knock down jumpers whenever he gets to his spot …. Active, relentless defender with disruptive wingspan and good lateral quickness … Shows solid instincts and anticipation and gets blocks and steals without gambling … Versatile defender … Can switch onto 1-5 as a solid on ball defender on the perimeter and also holds his own in the post … Shows good feel as a help defender as well … Averaging 1.5 steals per game and around a block per game … Plays with a high level of energy at all times … Intelligent decision maker … Really seems to have a solid understanding of the game and plays with a lot of poise and maturity for a freshman … Also gives a high level of consistency with his effort and focus … Quality free-throw shooter (80% FT) , which is encouraging for continued success as a shooter at all three levels … Long strides and a quick first step allows him to get by most similar sized defenders with ease and gets to the rim in a flash … Good cutter who finishes lobs and layups around the basket with high efficiency … Elite athlete who can ignite a crowd and offense with flashy, powerful dunks in transition … Protects the ball with only 1.8 turnovers per game despite high usage rate (27%) … Stays out of foul trouble even with his aggressive, energetic, physical defensive style … Well-rounded two-way forward with great size and length combined with high degree of potential … Has the versatility/mobility to play as a small forward in big lineups, but appears best suited for the 4 position with his ability to create mismatches and rebound … Ability to defend the perimeter at his size is an added dimension missing from the other top bigs at the top of this draft … Emerging as potentially the top prospect in the top-heavy 2022 class as perhaps the safest floor combined with an intriguing ceiling …","Rebounding numbers could stand some improvement (6.2 per game), granted he’s playing away from the rim at times and has an elite bigman that he is sharing the front court with (Walker Kessler) … Added strength will allow him to play more physical around the rim … Average ball-handler who struggles to get to the basket on his own … If he can improve as an ISO guy it will open up his outside game further …. Decent passer but could improve in this department as well … Often settles for perimeter jumpers or lower percentage mid-range jumpers because of his reluctance/inability to get to the basket and create for others in the half-court offense … Still a small sample size offensively, but the physical traits are there to sustain efficient success with his jumper … Doesn’t create a ton of space for himself when he catches entry passes at the elbow. Usually settles for mid-range jumpers upon these entries … When he does drive, it is almost exclusively to his right as his drives to his left often end in turnaround jumpers … Needs to become a better ball-handler in order to improve upon these weaknesses …",82,220,19.13
Keegan Murray,4,"A 6’8 225 frontcourt player with the frame, length, and mobility to play minutes all along the frontcourt in the NBA, especially as he fills out his frame … Agile; moves well laterally and has pretty decent leaping skills too, gets off the floor quickly off one or 2 feet … A smooth frontcourt player with the ability to move better than many similarly sized players, making him a big mismatch offensively at the college level with some translatable skills to the pros … Very good floor spacer, has a soft shooting touch and consistent shot mechanics from all 3 levels of the floor, and can do damage spotting up and hitting shots from long range (nearly 40% 3FG on 4.7 attempts), pulling up off the bounce and attacking closeouts, or using turnaround jumpers from the low or mid post … Also is effective in pick-and-pop situations, and shows budding ability to hit some jumpers with range off screens … Possesses a rangy 1st step that college frontcourt players struggled to defend all season when he attacked off the dribble, and knows how to slither in tight spaces or spin into the lane under control for high percentage shots when defenders happen to cut off his driving lanes … Solid post-up player, particularly when matched up on smaller players, and has a good command of jump hooks & up and under moves when he establishes position … More of a finesse player than physical, but shouldn’t be confused with a player who is afraid of contact in the paint, and will occasionally finish with authority at the rim … His huge production jump from his Freshman to Sophomore season (from 7.2 ppg to 23.5 ppg) is eye-opening and encouraging; but his shot selection to get that production was also outstanding (55% FG, career 54%) and he rarely looks like he’s forcing scoring opportunities outside of the offensive flow … Looks comfortable as a ball handler initiating transition opportunities after missed shots or turnovers … Will make some hustle plays and is active moving without the ball, gets a fair share of points without having plays drawn up for him as a cutter and in transition … Rebounds his area well (nearly 9 rpg), but is particularly effective as an offensive rebounder (nearly 3 Orpg as a Soph.) who regularly got put backs by being active on the glass and using his long arms … Effective shot-blocker (nearly 2 bpg as a Soph, career 1.6 bpg) showing nice timing and using his length to alter shots near the rim or get back into plays when beat off the bounce … Moves his feet well, rarely gets in foul trouble, and also has quick hands (over 1 spg); has the tools needed to be able to switch onto the perimeter and hold his own and sometimes even smother smaller matchups while guarding along the frontline as well … Gets to the line at a decent clip (over 5 attempts per game at around 75 FT%) … Doesn’t turn the ball over much (just 1.1 topg), especially for his usage … High IQ player and late bloomer who clearly works hard on his game giving his emergence from his 1st season to now …","Will have some questions about his true position at the next level; though his length allows him to play bigger than he is, at 6’8 he may be better suited as more of a PF or ‘small ball’ C than the combo forward he is seen as at the college level, especially as he fills out his frame … For as productive a scorer as he was for Iowa as a Soph., Murray didn’t quite prove to be a natural perimeter shot creator … Is comfortable handling in the open court and he’s hard to contain in the mid and high post, but he can be loose with the ball from the perimeter off the dribble and it’s tough to project him facing up and breaking down NBA level combo forwards on the perimeter consistently … Was an efficient shooter, but did have some inconsistency from deep this season at times and is still improving … Seems to prefer to drive and finish with his right, did have some awkward possessions when that side of the rim was cut off and he had to use his off hand … Defensively, Murray on occasion will rely too much on his length to gamble for steals/deflections by fronting post entry passes with no help around, and it can lead to easier shots in the paint when he’s unsuccessful … May struggle to defend on the perimeter as his lateral speed is not exceptional … May have been a function of his role on the team because he doesn’t seem selfish, but Murray doesn’t pass the ball much … Has underrated strength, but did at times struggle with his efficiency when defended by physical match ups who could contain his dribble penetration … Older than your average Soph. after spending a year in prep school before attending Iowa, will be 22 years old at the start of his rookie season …",80,225,21.86
Jaden Ivey,5,"An aggressive explosive, 6’4 200 lb combo guard with solid length (wingspan rumored to be somewhere in the 6’7-6’9 range) and a strong frame that should allow him to match up well on the perimeter … Very quick-twitched, Ivey is a premier athlete in the 2022 draft class who runs the floor exceptionally well given his outstanding burst and speed, and has the explosive leaping ability off of one or two feet to play above the rim with ease … A terror in the open court, plays with a high motor and is always looking to attack and put pressure on the defense; whether filling the lanes for off ball run outs or handling the ball in transition himself … Attentive off the ball and will slip behind defenders for easy cuts to the rim if his match up is late to react/out of position..Finishes well at the basket even when contested amongst the trees, has enough power and touch to score through contact … Makes good things happen when the defense isn’t set but only needs half a step on his man to collapse the paint and get to the rim in the half court with or without a ball screen due to his very quick 1st step and long-striding speed … Ivey is comfortable driving and dishing and in pick and roll situations (especially going right); rewards Purdue’s big front court players with plenty of high percentage looks near the rim off the attention he gets from slashing (3.3 apg as a Soph.) … A really active, quick-handed defender who plays strong on-ball defense at the college level, but is just as adept at jumping passing lanes and causing deflections, likes to flip turnovers into points … Has the athleticism needed to get back in plays after getting beat, capable of making nice chase down blocks … Projects very well to being able to defend anywhere on the perimeter at the NBA level given his physical tools and intensity level, and is among the best overall defenders in this upcoming class … Also a willing rebounder (5.2 rpg) who looks to initiate offense off missed shots..A rapidly improving 3-point shooter (41% 3FG currently as a Soph. on 5 attempts per game, up from just 26% last season) who has made defenses pay when they give him space this season … Ivey possesses decent release speed and touch; has shown flashes of being able to make shots on the move using screens, but especially off the bounce and spotting up with his feet set … Has a couple of rangy step back moves he uses for separation at times to get his shot off … Sporadically uses runners and floaters in the mid-range area, both shots that would be useful to continue to develop considering his play style … Has become a very difficult match up at the college level with his improved shot, as it only adds to the pressure he can put on the defense and puts his matchups at his mercy for blow-bys when closing out on him … Rapidly improved overall scoring efficiency (just under 40% FG last season to 48% on increased volume so far as a Soph.) points to a hard working player who is playing to his strengths while putting in the time to improve his game elsewhere…Has fan favorite traits, given his energy level and highlight reel athleticism, but also will endear himself to coaches and teammates with his contagious effort and solid intangible traits…Gets to the foul line at a decent rate and is an OK FT shooter once he gets there (career 74% on just over 4 FTs per game)","Ivey’s hard charging energy and play style can be projected to be both a gift and a curse, as he can also straddle being too aggressive and being out of control on both ends … Gambles and reaches for steals and will pick up unnecessary fouls or get himself out of proper position, washing himself out of plays at times … High IQ players will undoubtedly be able to have some success using his aggressive approach against him, whether it be stepping in for charges or baiting him into live ball turnovers by getting caught in no man’s land … Offensively, if his speed doesn’t break down the help side level of the defense, he occasionally shows questionable patience and shot selection … Can stand to improve on switching up the pace he plays at more often … Should look to polish his mid-range game, would benefit from adding 1 and 2 dribble pull up shots when chased off the 3-point line …Improved passer but not quite a natural playmaker for others (3.3 apg/2.2 topg); leaves his feet to make passes often, which telegraphs and will allow  defenders the time to recover and close passing angles more quickly … Has some misdirection in his game, but is mostly an average ball-handler who prefers to use his speed and rangy strides to maneuver … Gets low lift on his jumper and shoots a set shot, which is less of a concern for him from the 3-point line given the improvement and shot-making range he’s shown this season, but it will likely make the development of his floaters and runners more imperative at the NBA level … Some consider him a potential point for the next level, but for now he is more of a wing than a true lead guard …",76,195,20.37
Bennedict Mathurin,6,"6’7 wing with tremendous size, maturity, explosiveness and scoring skills that should help him make a quick transition to the next level … Elite spot-up shooter who can flourish in a lesser role early in his career before making strides to stardom later on … Shows some ability to utilize a floater … Aggressive slasher with a quick burst and powerful first step … Finishes with good strength and tremendous body control … Rim punisher who can bring the house down with athletic and pulverizing poster dunks (ie dunk vs TCU) … Plays with a ton of energy off the ball on offense with great cuts … Extremely athletic wing with good size for a scorer and long enough arms to be disruptive when he is locked in defensively … Sensational athlete who can elevate with anyone and really run in transition … Everyone on Arizona knows how to cut, but his change of direction is elite and he can create a lot of separation for himself in this department … Excellent form on his shot, with crisp mechanics and a consistent form … Incredible shooting range and big-shot maker with a ton of confidence (also see TCU game) … Good feel for his mid-range jumper and also makes decent reads in pick-and-roll action at the free-throw line … High energy offensive player who can crash the offensive glass with an NBA frame and plenty of upside at just 19-years-old until June … Clutch. High intangibles guy who really elevates his play in big situations … Very determined, hard working player as his immense improvement illustrates … Despite some lapses defensively, shows a ton of upside as a defender due to his athleticism and determination …","The biggest hurdle for Mathurin at this point is his inability to create offense consistently off the dribble … Defensive effort and intensity is  inconsistent … Still growing and learning the nuances of playing on the wing …  Doesn’t always work hard on box outs and can surrender a ton of offensive rebounds … Could struggle with high energy offensive players as most of his effort comes on the offensive end … Gets lost at times on the defensive end due to ball-watching and can get bullied when he does engage on box outs … Needs to show more energy in transition defense … Free-throw percentage took a dip from 84% to 76% but his volume went up and his mechanics are still sound … Lateral quickness and anticipation is a step behind on defense with smaller guards able to blow past him … Self-creation will need some time to develop, but he has the tools and potential to make this a strength in a few years time … Doesn’t possess the biggest wingspan, but appears to have solid length, with a wingspan likely a few (2-3) inches longer than his height …",78,205,20.02
Shaedon Sharpe,7,"An incredibly athletic wing who ranked as the top prospect in the 2022 recruiting class before reclassifying into the 2021 class and enrolling at Kentucky in January … An elite run/jump athlete with very good strength to play through contact and play physical … Against high schoolers showed three-level scoring ability and sound shooting mechanics … At  6’6, 210 pounds, Sharpe has a good NBA frame with potentially more growth on the way … Tremendous length with a near 7-foot wingspan … Big, strong hands give him excellent control of the ball … Versus high school kids, showed the ability to move well laterally on defense to stay in front of opposing ball-handlers and has long arms to create steals and disrupt offensive action … Shows good self-creation ability with tight handles and a step-back jumper that allows him to create a ton of separation … Has developed a patented fade to his jumper that gives him more space to get his shot away … Certainly has NBA range on his jumper that he showed during the EYBL tournament … Can seal off in the low-post and has a scoring arsenal with his back turned as well in the high post … One of the highest upside players available for this year’s draft …","Focus, intensity and maturity remain mysteries … Has some incredible high school footage, but these highlight clips can be misleading as they do not include the entire picture … Hasn’t played a competitive game since the 2021 Nike EYBL, making him a huge question mark in the upcoming draft … While there’s obviously a lot to be excited about, having seen him rise to being ranked by many as the top player in high school, the fact that he hasn’t proven it against a higher level of competition, at the college or G League level, is concerning … A real leap of faith pick if taken in the top half of the lottery … Gained a reputation in high school for not always bringing a high level of intensity and effort … Still extremely young and could have a long learning curve ahead of him … Quickness is solid, but doesn’t appear to have blow by speed to get by opponents off the dribble … Reclassifying athletes have struggled with the college game but Sharpe will have to make an even larger jump to the NBA game … Lack of true competition makes it more difficult to project him as a player, not to mention what kind of team player he is … Shot selection was questionable during his time at EYBL … Three-point shot could take some time to become efficient, has the tendency to try to shoot himself out of slumps, which won’t fly without solid production in the NBA …",77,200,19.08
Dyson Daniels,8,"6-6 combo guard with great size and length for his position … Active participant on both ends of the floor … Solid rebounder for a guard … Good break starter with the ability to thread the needle in transition and get downhill fast … A good transition cutter without the ball in his hand … Has the ability to penetrate in the half court and navigate through traffic around the rim … Extremely efficient floater, the most important part of his offensive game and a true “giant-killer” move … Solid form and fluidity on his jumper from the outside, while he is willing to take it, will need to start making them going forward … Has potential to become a spot up and catch and shoot threat as he grows, good court vision and passing ability with the ball in his hand..proven pick and roll threat at the international level, more spacing at the next level will make him a better passer out of the PNR … Has potential to be one of the top two way rookies in his class..size and length allow him to disrupt passing lanes that lead to easy transition baskets, good motor with the ability to defend multiple positions through traffic and without fouling..only averaging 2.1 fouls a game this season..stays low in his stance and has shown he can flip his hips with his back to the basket … Has room to grow as a team defender, has shown flashes as a weak side and help defender around the rim, size allows him to be a good shot blocker for his position, can also stop the ball and defend through the pick and roll … A  player that an NBA organization will likely look to invest in based on two way potential … Outisde shot still needs work but his form shows promise …","While his skill potential is high. Feel for the game seems to still be a work in progress … A good athlete, but that doesn’t always translate to the floor…Isn’t super explosive and struggles to finish as often as he should … Lacks a great first step to create separation …  Has trouble elevating over bigger defenders, which could be a product of age and maturing … Often alters his shot instead of trying to take contact making it harder on himself to convert … Length and size give him advantage with smaller defenders but bigger rim protectors give him problems on the inside…on the outside he is a basic dribbler with no real moves and doesn’t have a quick first step, guards have been able to stay in front of him and force the ball out his hand…only shooting 1.5 FTA per game … An average ball handler, has room to grow to become the starting primary ball handler at the next level..carries the ball high when bringing it up the floor or operating in the halfcourt, smaller quicker guards could get under him and force turnovers..will be challenged to keep defenders from pressing him..outside of taking the ball to the rim, he lacks creativity and can’t create his own shot or shake a defender from the outside, slow release of the ball … Has shown some hesitation when shooting from outside..little to no mid-range game, limited on the offensive end … Could have trouble with smaller guards and has gotten lost when defending off the ball … Can work on decision making when deciding to get into passing lanes, too many gambles could leave him behind the ball and put additional pressure on the rest of his teammates to defend … Outside shooting needs work, as he seems to shoot a bit of a set shot and still has a ways to go from a efficiency standpoint …",79,195,19.28
Jeremy Sochan,9,"The less heralded freshman Baylor forward, Sochan has flown up draft boards in recent weeks because of his rare physical traits and perceived versatility and upside … Perfect length and build for the modern forward, with the agility and verticality to cover every position … Can be utilized as a defensive chess piece, swarming smaller guards or using his long arms as a useful weak side rim protector … Still raw in certain basketball skills, but his youth (19 on draft day) and athleticism point to a very high ceiling … Got better as the season progressed, becoming a more consistent offensive weapon for the Bears, averaging 12.25 points over his final eight games, including hitting 17 twice over that stretch … The American born, Polish forward is a stellar rebounder despite his position, grabbing 9.1 rebounds per 36 minutes … Flashed some self-creation in smaller role (9.2 ppg in 25 minutes), but mostly scored off of assists … Could be a high-level scorer in a few years if he can build on a solid three-point shooting form … Has the length, strength and burst to attack the rim, generating scoring chances, especially while on the fast break … A high motor on the glass and in transition … One of the best defenders in the class despite his youth … 1.3 steals per game … Almost two assists per game even with limited time with the ball in his hands … Shows a good feel for the game …","Most lottery picks have more scoring production and efficiency while in college than Sochan, who shot just 47% from the floor, 30% from deep and 60% from the free throw line … Those numbers need to see a dramatic increase to be a useful offensive player at the next level … Can struggle with turnovers trying to create offense, turning the ball over four times in five games this season … Fouls attackers too often, and doesn’t go straight up near the rim … Needs to use his 7’0 wingspan to deter drivers rather than fouling … Will probably take a season or two to get consistent minutes because of his lack of polish and experience … Poor offensive advanced stats … Has very intriguing potential, but also has low floor because of his putrid shooting and efficiency on offense … Not a threat in the post while matched up against smaller defenders … Hasn’t yet discovered best use of his elite athleticism to score around the rim … His success could be contingent upon landing with a quality organization that excels in developing young players …",81,230,19.11
Johnny Davis,10,"A 6’5 190 SG/SF with the athleticism and wiry strong frame that project solidly for an NBA swingman…Runs the court hard and plays with an aggressive, confident mindset that bodes well looking at his potential on both ends at the NBA level…Nice transition player who is tough to contain when he has a head of steam on his way to the basket, being effective at both creating contact to draw fouls (over 6 FT a game on a solid 79% as a Soph.) and using his excellent body control to create space for driving lanes…Promising ability to post up smaller guards, is stronger than his size suggests and is skilled at using his shoulders to create space for turnaround jumpers…Looks good operating at the mid-range level, and is most confident as a shooter from about 15-18 ft…Pretty solid pull up jumper from the mid range…Is a factor in the dribble handoff & pick and roll game too, showing a nice rhythm pulling up off of 2 dribbles…Developing range and shotmaking ability, occasionally made defenders pay as a spot up shooter in the relatively few possessions he played off the ball..Put points on the board in a hurry (19 ppg) often for a team that played at a slow pace all season, and his emergence as a breakthrough player (over 12 ppg and 10 mpg increase from Fr to Soph season) is most impressive because of the amount of defensive attention he received as the year progressed…Projects to become a tough defender as well, where his competitive nature, solid fundamentals, and quick feet make him a nuisance on the ball currently…Impressed many college hoop observers with his willingness to guard the other teams best offensive wings regularly, even though he shouldered so much of an offensive load…Has enough of the twitchy athleticism and instincts needed to be a threat in the passing lanes (1.1 spg for his career), while also having quick reactions when contesting shots and recovering from getting around screens…Reads action instinctively and often diagnoses set plays before they unfold to force turnovers or bad shots…His nose for the ball and aggressiveness also shows itself on the boards, where Davis ranks among the very best in this class regardless of position statistically (8.2 rpg)…Somewhat of a late bloomer who has garnered experience both as a role player and go-to guy early in his prospect development, could be able to hang his hat in some playing roles that would allow him to contribute to an NBA rotation sooner than later while he refines other areas of his game…His massive improvements from his Fr to Soph season show that he is a hard-working player, while his ability to fight through late season injuries to help Wisconsin in conference and NCAA tourny games show his toughness and dedication to his team","Was asked to be a go-to scorer last season out of necessity, but his aggressive nature overshadowed that he doesnt have the most natural feel for the game offensively…Posted no better than an even A/TO in both of his college seasons (2.1/2.3 this past season), and didnt show the necessary court vision, timing or willingness passing the ball to project well to the primary ball handler role he so often played in college…Shot selection needs to improve (42% FG), he has some struggles getting into the paint against athletic defenders and with finishing at the rim amongst the trees once there, which leads him to try numerous heavily contested shots off the bounce with mixed results (just 46% FG from inside the arc in his career)…Some will point to his late season ankle injury for his explosiveness and efficiency tailing off, and while it did contribute to it, he hasn’t really posted more than average production finishing at the basket even when fully healthy…More rangy than sudden as a slasher, relies more on angles and off balanced defenders to create separation than ball-handling or quickness…At times Davis dribbles too much when creating and is somewhat predictable with his moves, as teams started to successfully anticipate his stepback jumper more and more as the season went along…Can sometimes play into high IQ defenders hands by being overly physical when creating offense, and gets called for fouls using his off arm to create space at times…Had occasional good moments as a 3-point shooter off the dribble, and while his shot isn’t broken he was not an efficient shooter from beyond the arc as a Soph (30% 3FG) and endured a long shooting slump from deep through the last 2 months of the season…Has an average release speed on his shot that makes him project better as an off-ball set shooter from deep, and though he has been solid at it in his career (ex. he shot 38% 3FG on limited attempts as a Fr) he hasnt really been given many chances to show it due to being

Which leads to the question of if he is being challenged, which likely means that he isn’t going to drastically improve any aspect of his game this season, aside from confidence, while the rest of his class is progressing, playing in college, overseas or with the Ignite … Going forward he should work to become more involved on the defensive side of the floor … Even though he excels at jumping passing lanes, this also leads to gambling for balls when he should be playing his man … In his recent games for Overtime Elite he has been a bit too straight up … He also has a tendency to let his defender slip by him with or without the ball … This is especially true in the pick and roll as ball handlers seem to be able to get downhill on Montero with ease, raising questions about his ability to defend high level guards in the NBA … As he improves on the defensive end, he will also have an opportunity to develop further on the offensive end.

Michael Foster,-1,"Finished the year averaging 16.3/9.5/2.5 in 22 contests with shooting splits of 49.8/31.0/76.1, Foster gave glimpses of why he was considered one of the best players in the nation during his high school career … A power forward that has good size and strength for his position and should only become more physically imposing on both ends of the floor as he matures … His physical gifts allow him to be an active rebounder on both ends and get deep into the post when given the chance to back down his defender … While he isn’t an elite leaper or rim gazer, he does get off the ground quickly aiding his ability to win 50/50 balls … In transition, Foster has shown in the past that he can start the break off a rebound but as the season progressed he began deferring to his teammates and playing within his role more often … Understanding how to fill the lane coupled with the coordination of being able to catch and finish around the rim had led to easy transition points throughout the G-league showcase … An offensive minded forward, Foster can space the floor with his occasional three point shooting … While Foster can shoot the three, the majority of his offensive game runs through the post … As previously mentioned, Foster uses his strength to get deep into the post and finish around the rim … Being able to finish on both sides of the block, he challenges defenders every time he touches the ball … When he is not backing his defender down, he has shown that he can create space through a post fade … In addition to his post offense versatility, the relief of not seeing nearly as many double teams as he did during high school allowed his game to breathe … However, based on his past experiences he has proven that when challenged with multiple defenders he remains calm and works through the extra pressure … Currently, his passing ability stands at flashes of playmaking potential which should develop moving forward … If he can expand his court vision and become a playmaker out of the post it will only increase his chances of breaking into a starting lineup during his career … An area that Foster has improved upon and should look to continue to build upon is his ability to play within his role … Taking a step back from being the focal point of the offense has helped Foster understand where to pick and choose his spots …","Foster clearly shows ability and potential but still has areas of his game that he must continue to improve … On the surface his shooting splits show an efficient player but going forward he should look to develop his three point shooting so he can be a true floor spacer at the next level … Currently averaging only one three point attempt a game, additional volume when it fits the flow of the offense should help him improve over time … In addition to his lack of three point attempts, he is only averaging a pair of free throw attempts which is frustrating given the size and strength he has  … Shooting 75% is solid but may be slightly inflated considering his limited trips to the line … This also leads to a question about his offensive aggression when he receives the ball in the post, on many possessions when Foster has position he will back his opponent into the paint and work for a layup. However, if he is met with resistance, he can be forced into taking a bad shot out of the post … While he does have the ability to make fade aways, they aren’t always the best shot on the floor, which should come with developing as a passer … Foster’s jumpshot is fluid and looks to have strong mechanics from the shoulders down, the one question mark that may arise is how far he brings the ball back … His firm breaks down on outside shots … He brings the ball behind his head when shooting three point attempts … This could become less efficient in the NBA as the size, length and speed of his opponents increases … Defensively, he doesn’t have the athletic ability/explosiveness to be an elite shot blocker or rim protector and lacks the length to be a consistent disruptor in passing lanes … Moving forward he should continue to work on his defensive positioning and team defense … He isn’t the slowest defender and can challenge shots but l found himself out of position at times this season.",81,235,19.45

Can make up his mind immediately after the entry pass whether he wants to shoot or pass, causing him to make poor reads on some possessions … Efficiency isn’t great in the post and he can throw up some crazy shots … More of a traditional post scorer making him less accustomed for the modern game from a scoring standpoint … Without the development of an outside jumper, his scoring style won’t fit in today’s NBA and his lack of efficiency could be frustrating and cost him minutes early on …",80,265,21.78
