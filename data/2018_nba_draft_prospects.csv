Deandre Ayton,1,"Tremendous physical profile (7’1”, 250 pounds) … Fits the profile of a physical freak and a ""Generational center"" … Figures to be among if not the top center in the league in his prime … Already has an NBA ready body, and a physique ideally designed for the game of basketball … Moves exceptionally well for his size … Runs the floor well and really excels in the transition … Plays physical, showing a willingness to bang and seek out contact … He’s capable of reliably hitting open jumpers, even developing a three-point game (34.3% on 1 attempt per game) … Has very good hands … Has good form on his shot, shooting 73.3% from the foul line … Knows how to score in a variety of ways: Around the rim, mid-range, and beyond (20.1 points per game) … Developing solid post moves and has exceptional footwork … Good in both pick and roll and pick and pop situations … While able to dunk in traffic with ease, he isn’t overly reliant on his physical gifts to score … Does a good job controlling the glass and the paint, averaging 11.6 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game … Very active on the offensive glass, good at getting tip-ins and put backs … Has a really quick second jump and follows his own misses really well … Does a good job defending without fouling (2.3 fouls per game) … Seems to be NBA ready from a mental standpoint … Was comfortable handling the work load night in and night out at Arizona … Pretty consistent player, giving good energy every minute he’s on the floor … Rarely had an off night. Made a huge impact in college from day one … Already looked like he could hang with NBA players the moment he stepped on the floor at in Tucson … Fits today’s NBA extremely well with his ability to knock down outside shots … Scored a majority of his points in the post, generally outclassing opponents with ease, with his huge size/talent differential. But has developing skills to operate both on the block and facing the basket. Has a lot of natural ability and his post game can advance tremendously if he’s given the proper instruction …","Defensive awareness needs to improve. For a player with such elite physical gifts, his shot blocking ability is curiously average (though he seemed to improve as freshman season progressed). He should be able to improve upon this over time, given the proper coaching and desire … Needs to do a better job guarding against the pick and roll. Can sometimes lose his man … Needs to do better as a help defender … Can get flat footed at times … And seemed to look to preserve energy (and fouls) on the defensive end … While capable of scoring at all three levels, jumper (inparticular shot selection) still needs improvement … Tends to shoot it a bit short and at times can rush his shot … Needs to follow through and also look to improve his touch around the basket … Needs to do a better job of commanding the ball inside and establishing position. He’s so big and strong that he will be very difficult to stop from extablishing position at the next level once his strength peaks out and he fully understands utilizing position and getting low … Sometimes is a bit passive and can be lazy at times, though he played with a solid level of energy for the most part throughout his college career …  Needs to do a better job contesting shots on the perimeter … Needs to do a better job scoring in traffic … If crowded, you can bother him and force him to take a difficult shot or turn the ball over … Will need to improve ability to handle double teams …",84,260,19.93
Marvin Bagley,2,"NBA-ready body … Positional versatility … Displays unusually smooth and fluid movements for his 6’11”, 234-pound frame … Elite and agile athlete … Great lateral quickness … Exceptional leaper (jumps well off both feet) …Elevates quickly and really gets off the floor well for his second and third jumps … Plays effortlessly above the rim … Possesses great hands and quick feet… Catches everything that comes his way … Very coordinated in his movements … Has good body control … Good overall ball-handler for a big man … Multifaceted offensive skillset … Versatile/natural scorer … Polished footwork in the post … Can shoulder his team’s offensive load … Gets to the rim easily … Strong finisher around the basket with a soft touch … Can score around the rim with either hand … Solid low post scorer … Possesses a bevy of floaters, runners, and hook shots … Gets his defenders off balance with an array of ball fakes … Does a good job of working around the rim and getting himself open … Has shown the ability to expand his game and take his opponents off the dribble using his quick foot speed … He’s shown flashes of being able to take his game beyond the 3-point line … Has the potential to be a stretch 4/5 and a catch-and-shoot player … Solid shooting form and can develop into a reliable mid-range/outside shooter shooter at the next level … He has developed a nice mid-range jumper, which he can get off of turnarounds or on step back moves … Plays well from the triple threat position, including a nice jab step … Has the tools to be a dual pick-and-roll threat … Offensive rebounding/nose for the ball … Reacts quickly to rebound his own misses … Has a knack for turning offensive rebounds into second-chance points, especially in traffic … He keeps possessions alive and shows great timing cleaning up after missed shots … Can take a defensive rebound and go coast to coast, either finishing in the lane or setting up a teammate for an open shot … Has the ability to run the floor paired with the agility to euro-step in big spaces and decelerate … Decent, but not elite, instincts for defending the rim and blocking shots … Can effectively challenge shooters using his length in isolation situations to force contested shots … He’s great at switching in pick-and-roll situations … Can stay in front of guards and wings on the perimeter … Jumps passing lanes well … Can be a menace on defense when he’s locked in … Coach K has praised his practice habits and work ethic …  Has built a strong reputation as a high character kid … Has the desire to be great … Motor is one of his strongest assets … Plays with great competitiveness and physicality … Out-works and out-hustles his opponents … Commands the ball and looks to dominate … One of the youngest prospects available for this year’s draft. Won’t turn 20 years old until March of his rookie season … Appears to potentially be an ideal small ball five for today’s NBA …","Lacks the wingspan of other big men in his class … Has to continue to fill out his frame with upper and lower body strength … Sometimes gets out-muscled in the paint/post … Lack of strength keeps him from controlling the paint on defense … Ball handling is solid but still needs to get better handling in tight spaces … Needs to prove that he can score consistently with his right hand (i.e. dribbling and finishing with his right) … Will turn down good looks with his right hand to shoot contested shots with his left … Even if he’s forced right, he’ll try to finish with his left … Needs to trust his right hand more and not be too predictable with his dribble drive and post up moves … Low post game needs to get more refined … Far from a finished product in terms of outside shooting, although he’s developing … Because he crashes the offensive glass so often, he doesn’t get back in transition as much as he should … Not a natural passer … Overlooks open shooters … Can sometimes miss the easy pass … Plays toward the basket with tunnel vision … Isn’t a physical screen setter (avoids contact) … Although he’s a great rebounder and puts up great numbers on the boards, it’s more so because of his athleticism than his rebounding fundamentals … Doesn’t get good leverage on box outs … He’s not a true rim protector at this point … Fails to challenge shots at the rim because he tends to shy away from contact … Still needs to improve his defensive fundamentals, timing, and rotations … Ball-watches a lot on defense … Shot just 62% from the charity stripe … Seems to be a jack of all trades but master of none …",83,235,19.28
Luka Doncic,3,"Versatile all around guard/forward who can do just about everything on the court … Probably the most mature prospect that Europe has seen in years … His Basketball I.Q is off the charts … A natural born leader, excels under pressure, who takes and makes big shots … Not afraid of the big stage, since he has been the center of attention since he was 15 years old … He has been used as a point guard from young age and really knows how to control the tempo of the game … Looks like he will become a point forward in the future … Not very gifted athletically, but has some sneaky athleticim and length that helps him blow by opponents and make athletic finishes … Great size for a wing … Has really bulked up considerably the last few years and has lost some baby fat that he was carrying … Has great feel for the game … Very good ball handler, with a nice crossover and step back dribble on his repertoire… Nice hands that help him in all aspects of the game… Already a very good scorer, he can score in every way possible… When he gets hot is really difficult to stop him… Great shooting mechanics and good looking shooting form… His Pull-up game and shot of dribble are lethal… He is a threat on Spot Up and Catch and Shoot situations… Attacks closeouts and can either go all the way to the hop or stop and shoot… Knows his way around the screens and uses them excellent… Has the ability post-up smaller opponents and punish miss-matches with a variety of moves thanks to his good footwork… Drags bigs away from the basket on switches and tries to exploit any advantage on his favor… Can be effective without the ball in his hands… Good Free Throw shooter… Elite passing skills and court vision… He can pass from anywhere on the floor and everywhere on the floor since he is a really creative passer… Great passer on the move to the weakside, he can already make one hand passes… A true maestro in Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler, he is the dream of every rolling Big… After he receives a pick he can either find the rolling Big, pass to the weakside, go all the way to the basket, or shoot off the dribble… There isn’t a cover he hasn’t faced already, so he is really not surprised anymore against defenses… Great body control and balance on drives… He can penetrate from either side and finish to the basket with strong or finesse lay-ups and even some dunks when he finds room and jump of two feet… Excels in tranistion as a ball handler thanks to his amazing court vision, basketball I.Q and scoring ability… Very good rebounder for his position, especially on the defensive end… Adequate lateral quickness… Doesn’t back down on Defense and tries to make it difficult for his opponent to post him up… Smart help defender who knows where to stand, anticipating plays before happen…","He can be considered magrinally average athlete by NBA standards … Not overly long, more of an average actually…  His first step is slow even for European standrards … Not a very good leaper of one foot, his good jumps come of two feet … Must continue working on his body … He lost some flexibility while he was bulking up … Can be really emotional at times and lose concentration for a few plays… He can depend too much to his instict at times … If he doesn’t have momentum it’s difficult for him to finish plays at the rim… He must improve in changing speeds and pace … His ball handling still needs some polishing, especially with his left hand … Has problems against aggressive ball pressure from smaller, faster opponents … The lack of explosiveness makes it really difficult for him to create his own shoot against great athletes with good wignspan … Isn’t always able to punish switches when he has a versatile Big against him, especially if there are no shooters around him … He has the tendency to over-dribble, trying to find his way around his defender, icing-out teammates momentarily … It’s a questionmark whether he will be able to create consistently at the next level on ISO situations … Finds it difficult to finish in traffic and against elite length … Finishing against contact might be an issue at the next level … Shooting selecion can become a little iffy occasionally with some off balance shoots and long floaters … Can fall in love with his pull-up game and settle too much against switches … Kind of streaky shooter for now … Incosistent 3-point shooter … Must have feet set to shoot well in Catch and Shoot situations … His off the ball game should still improve a little bit more … The fact that he can see angles that no one else can see leads to some extreme passes and, as a consequence, some turnovers… His assist/turnover ratio could be better … He could be more involved on the offensive boards … Doesn’t always box out and depends on instict and position to grab defensive rebounds … He is not always engaged on defense … He should raise his intensity on the defensive end … Doesn’t keep a low stance all the time when he is guarding a ball handler , which makes it easier for his opponent to blow by him … It’s a questionmark who he could guard at the next level, since he has problems against smaller, quicker opponents, but also against athletic wings … Not always physical enough when he is defending in the post … Has problems reading screens on the defensive end … Has been targetted on defense on Pick and Roll situations that force switches to exploit his defensive limitations … Must be more aggressive on defensive close outs …",80,225,19.32
Jaren Jackson Jr.,4,"Very gifted athletically … Untapped potential … Impressive quickness/mobility/agility … His physical profile stands out as he’s listed at 6’11 and 235 lbs … His wingspan measured at 7’5 ¼” at this year’s NBA Combine (third longest player in the draft) … Standing reach is measured at 9’2, giving him tremendous size  … Fluid and coordinated as a runner…Has nice (huge) hands: measured at 10 inches in length … His offensive game is extremely versatile … He’s capable of facing up or playing with his back to the basket … Has shown the capability of hitting from mid-range … He flashed some offensive ball skills and control that could foreshadow his ability as an offensive talent … Great ball-handling skills for his size (he’s a near 7-footer who can effortlessly take defenders off the dribble with either hand) … Can put the ball on the floor in space, transition or on closeouts while using a variety of moves or making dump-off passes … Has a great first-step … Displayed great shooting consistency and efficiency from various areas of the floor: 59 percent on 2-pointers, 40 percent from the 3-point line, 51 percent overall from the field … Has nice touch and finishing ability around the rim with either hand … Active finisher around the basket … Can finish through contact … Showed a willingness to move without the ball … Constant threat to scores off cuts and with or without the ball in transition … Does a good job of running the baseline for alley-oops … Connected on 80 percent of his free throws … Defensively, he showed that he can defend in space and guard the perimeter extremely well for his size … Gets into his stance and slides his feet better than any other big man in his class … Projects to be the perfect defender for switches and closeouts at the next level … Shows good defensive awareness off the ball, allowing him to be a solid help defender and weakside shot blocker … Exceptional overall shot blocker, having averaged 3.0 blocks per game in his lone season at MSU … Possesses great rim protection, anticipation, range, and instincts … Solid post defender, didn’t bite on pump fakes often … He seems to always be quick to the ball … Never gives up on plays on defense … Goes hard after offensive rebounds (high-level offensive rebounder) … Has good timing on his putbacks … Plays aggressively and with hustle/energy … One of the youngest, if not the youngest, players in the draft … Won’t turn 19 years of age until September …","A late bloomer in regards to his physical frame as he’s still a bit on the thin side … Still very much a kid and will require additional time to fully mature both on and off the floor … Would benefit from developing more muscle/strength for the next level (especially in the upper body) … He’s not overly bouncy or explosive … His overall offensive game is still unpolished despite the promise it has … Jackson has a tendency to get into foul trouble (averaged 8.6 fouls per 100 possessions … A lot of his fouls stem from him being undisciplined on defense … Foul trouble was a main reason why his playing time was diminished throughout his FR season … Needs to work on maintaining his balance as a low-post defender … May need to tweak his shooting mechanics (low release, knuckleball), but still projects as a solid outside shooter … Although he shot a high percentage throughout the season, he did attempt just seven shots per game (what will he do with an expanded role?) … Needs to polish his shooting off the dribble … He was too passive and therefore inconsistent at times … Not an elite below-the-rim finisher … Needs to learn how to move onto the next play (maturity) and not check out the game (mentally) when he makes a bad play or something doesn’t go his way … Lacks passing awareness … Doesn’t look comfortable making decisions with the ball … Remains to be seen if he can develop into a playmaker … His assist-to-turnover ratio left a lot to be desired … Not a shifty enough ball-handler in traffic … Can be a little wild and out of control when he puts the ball on the floor … Does not have a go-to move in the post that he can rely upon … Still developing the footwork that’ll be necessary as a viable low-post threat against bigger and stronger players in the NBA …",83,235,18.78
Trae Young,5,"Trae Young early on in his freshman season is doing things that college basketball fans rarely see … Through Oklahoma’s first ten games, he averaged nearly 30 points and nine assists per game, which is unheard of for any player let alone a freshman … Young has also yet to score fewer than 22 points since the season opener … Young is just the fourth high-major freshman guard in seven years to record a usage rate higher than 30 percent … Two of those players, D’Angelo Russell and Markelle Fultz, were top-two draft picks … The first thing that jumps out about Young is his seemingly limitless shooting range … Young is a threat to score from anywhere on the court once he crosses half court and can effortlessly knock down shots beyond the NBA three-point line … He may be the best shooter in college basketball since Stephen Curry played at Davidson … What separates Young from other great shooters is that, like Curry, he has the ability to knock down shots from distance off a variety of dribble moves and not just off the catch or off of simple one-dribble pull ups … He has a quick, compact release with minimal wasted motion that allows him to get his shot off even in tight space … Young’s jumper unlocks numerous other options offensively for him … Although he is not the most explosive athlete, the threat of his jumper forces defenders to guard him way out on the perimeter, making it easier for him to get by his man and into the paint … Young has shown the ability to create his own shot from inside the arc with a solid handle … He has a great floater from the mid range area as well that he can score with consistently when he is not able to get all the way to the rim … Young’s ability to operate out of the pick and roll is very advanced for a player of his age … He makes great decisions and quick reads off of ball screens and is always under control … Young always plays with his head up in these situations and shows great vision in the half court and in transition … He puts his passes on target and in spots on the court where his teammates are comfortable playing … He also does a nice job of not forcing passes and making the simple play when nothing extra is needed … In transition, Young does an excellent job of leading the break and is dangerous due to his combination of vision and craftiness around the rim … When he goes to the basket, he is adept at using his body to shield himself from bigger defenders and finish through contact … He can score with both hands or dish it to open teammates to lead to an easy basket.","Young does not have ideal size at 6-2 or length with just a 6-2 wingspan for an NBA guard … These physical limitations can become apparent once he gets all the way to the rim … He lacks the length and vertical explosiveness to finish through NBA length and athleticism and does not project as an efficient scorer at the basket in the NBA … He will have to rely much more on craft to be successful inside at the next level … He has been a bit turnover prone at times this season due to his tendency to make some risky passes at times … However, much of that is due to his unusually high usage rate, and he still has an assist to turnover ratio of better than two to one … Young’s shot selection at times leaves a lot to be desired … As good of a shooter as he is, there are times where he will hoist a very long jumper early in the shot clock without moving the ball and looking for a better opportunity first … As polished as Young is offensively, he is a near liability on defense … He rarely gets into a stance on this end of the floor and shows poor effort guarding the ball … Opposing guards are easily able to get into the lane against him and he is often caught ball-watching when his man does not have the ball … Due to his lack of ideal size and athleticism, he will be a guy for opposing offenses to attack … He is not explosive enough to stay in front of quick guards, and he is also not big enough to stop anyone else on the court … The effort has to improve first and foremost, but even if it does he may never be a reliable defensive player unless he can create a high number of steals … Will need to add strengh to be able to better finish off drives and also defend …",74,180,19.77
Mohamed Bamba,6,"A truly elite physical specimen in terms of length, Mohamed Bamba jumps off the page with his 7’9” wingspan and 9’6” standing reach … This kind of size allowed him to immediately burst on to the NCAA scene as an elite rim protector with the measurables to translate this skill to the NBA … Blocking 3.7 shots per game during his regular season stint at Texas doesn’t even take into account the countless shots he altered or drive attempts he thwarted … Timing is a part of this, as he only averaged 2.4 fouls per contest at the college level … His lateral quickness is also very good for a player who measures in at 7 feet tall. This makes him a capable pick and roll defender and someone who roam the entire paint area with little effort … From a rebounding standpoint, his 10.4 boards per game as a freshman is well above average, and despite his narrow frame he held his own pretty well in the paint against stronger opponents … While Bamba will always be a lean player, he does have wide shoulders and looks to be able to add muscle … His 3.2 offensive rebounds per contest is also a very good indicator of timing around the rim … Mo Bamba’s offensive game is probably a little further along than you might initially think … He is a 67.8% free throw shooter, and has a nice high release and good backspin on his shot … In an era when long, defensive bigs are often poor free throw shooters, Mo appears to have the foundation to be pretty good at the charity stripe … His jump shot is also showing signs of life as Bamba shot 28% from the college 3 point line, and showed to be capable from the elbow, while showing decent shot selection … While his jumper and 3 point shot are not exactly calling cards at this point in his development, I’d still call his foundation as a shooter an strength overall … He’s also a decent ball handler for a big man, and has shown some impressive glimpses of his length and athleticism when putting the ball on the deck and driving past and then dunking on defenders … He plays with fire, and at the college level when he gets good position and is close to the rim he’s extremely tough to stop … Bamba definitely projects as a defender first at the next level, but he has the pieces in place , with continued development, to be a force on offense as well … An extremely bright individual, if not for basketball, he had Ivy league grades and credentials entering college …","As obvious is as length is, it’s also not hard to notice he’ll need to continue to add strength to play the paint in the next level …  At the 2017 Hoop Summit, he only weighed in at 216 pounds … Ideally, you’d like to see Bamba at least around 240 in a year or two, or possibly 250 … I think those weights are achievable for him judging by his length, and how he’s added muscle since high school … His awareness with his back to the basket and in the paint on offense is a work in progress too … He’ll need to continue to work on his awareness of spacing and cutting players, as well as adjusting to double teams and pressure from guards … When he’s feeling it offensively, he could take over a game at the college level, but he could also be too passive when he’d get bothered … Restraint is good from a team game perspective, but with his physical tools he should have been more aggressive at times while playing for the Longhorns … A solid athlete, but much of his wow factor is due to length and not explosiveness or leaping ability …",84,225,20.12
Wendell Carter,7,"NBA-ready body/strong frame … Carter is 6’10,"" 251 pounds with a 7′ 4.5” wingspan and a 9’1 standing reach … His substantial size/physical profile suggests that he has more than enough size to play at the center position full-time in the small-ball NBA … Offers a multitude of skills on both ends of the floor … He has great hands for a young big man … Highly coordinated and mobile on both ends of the floor … His offensive skill set is as versatile and polished as any other big man in the 2018 draft class … He consistently showcased the ability to score efficiently against high-level college competition … Powerful post player with agile footwork … He excels playing with his back to the basket … Loves to spin baseline … Has finesse in his game … Possesses an array of effective post moves … Can knock down jumpers facing up … Quick first step … Good handle on the ball for a big guy … He’s effective off-the-dribble from the face-up position – gets the rim and finishes … Attacks closeouts strong from the perimeter … Can finish through contact … Proved to be a strong/efficient scorer at the rim – shooting 56 percent from the field overall … Moves well without the ball, gets to the right spot, and does a great job carving out position in the lane and imposing his will on his defender … Has excellent timing when it comes to positioning himself for catch-and-dunk opportunities off guard penetration … Can consistently knock down jumpers from the post area and from mid-range … Shoots the ball with confidence … Has a soft touch on his jumper/shooting mechanics look clean … Stretch big potential … His jumper extends to the three-point line he hit 41 percent of his 46 total three-point attempts at Duke) … Can shoot off the catch and off 1-2 dribbles … Knocked down 74 percent of his free throws (great number for a big) … He has play-making upside … Willing to pass the ball/makes good passing decisions out of the low/high posts … Can throw skips from the post, drive-and-kick out of face-ups, and execute big-to-big interior passes … Moves the ball quickly to avoid double teams … Has shown the ability to pass on the move … Does a terrific job setting screens for his teammates … Knows how to play high low, seals his man when guard penetrates his way … Does a great job making plays either rolling to the basket or popping out towards the perimeter after setting screens … Defensively, he showed solid footwork in the post as well as good instincts … His length and vertical jumping ability paid dividends for him as a rim protector … Has shot-blocking prowess and solid overall defensive awareness … Jumps with his body and arms straight up to block shots … Disciplined about rotating to the rim and challenging shots … Tremendous rebounder – would have averaged more rebounds had he not been playing alongside Marvin Bagley III … Effective at clearing out space in the paint with his thick body to go for boards … Simply overpowered his opponents on the glass … Once a shot goes up, he recognizes the best position for him to secure the rebound and boxes out his man really well … Has a nose for the ball … Uses his rebounding instincts/motor to pull down loose balls in traffic and convert them into second-chance points …Very fundamentally sound player overall … Has a high basketball IQ/feel for the game … A good understanding of angles … Tough, physical player who doesn’t mind mixing it up inside … Runs the floor well/with long strides …","Good athlete, but he lacks elite athleticism and isn’t considered a run and jump athlete … Does not possess high-end burst, explosiveness, or foot speed (although that could potentially change and improve if he stays in shape/work on his body fat, which was measured at a subpar 7.85 percent at the combine) … Perimeter defense is a question mark … Needs to improve his agility as a perimeter defender … Typically moves well when going from east-west, but not so much when he has to change direction going north-south … May struggle to guard against small-ball lineups in the NBA, especially against quicker players in the pick-and-roll … Can help his team way more defensive if he becomes more willing to do the little things on that end of the floor … Shows flashes of being a good shooter and has solid mechanics, but he still needs to gain consistency from the floor and the foul line … Struggles shooting when he’s pressured and forced to release too soon (needs time and space to get his shot off) … His lack of burst, dynamic leaping ability, and above-the-rim play-making ability could become a challenge when trying to score against NBA size … Finishing in traffic can stand to improve (not a crafty finisher) … Not a transition finisher and seems to jump better off two feet … He’s a bit turnover and foul prone … 6’10"" height is considered to be undersized for a center, but it depends on the match-ups and if he’s playing against a small-ball lineup … His average size may make his team play him at power forward, where he wouldn’t be as good a fit as at the center position … Does a good job passing the ball right before double teams come, but if he waits too long, he doesn’t have the size to easily see over the top and can get rushed under pressure … Has relatively small hands for a bigman … Lacks the upside of some his fellow big men in his draft class (i.e. DeAndre Ayton, Mo Bamba, Jaren Jackson Jr., Marvin Bagley III)",82,250,19.19
Collin Sexton,8,"Sexton is one of the most dynamic guards in the country and has the tools to become a versatile weapon at the NBA level … Although he is slightly undersized in height at 6-2, he plays with great physicality, athleticism, and aggression, and has a 6’6.5 wingspan and a 8’0 standing reach … He’s a player that loves the spotlight and seems to be energized by the bright lights and stiff competition … He loves to play through contact and has the frame to absorb it when going to the rim … He has the strength and athleticism to finish through contact, and he also gets to the free throw line at a very high rate … Sexton still could stand to become more consistent from the charity stripe, but overall he converts his attempts at a more than proficient level … Sexton combines his strength with blazing speed, agility, and creative ball handling to form a lethal slashing arsenal … He does a great job of finding angles to get to the basket and changing directions to keep his defender off balance … Sexton also does a good job of changing speeds on the perimeter when coming off of ball screens or in isolation … That allows him to keep his man guessing and much more easily get into the lane … Sexton is constantly in attack mode looking to make a play … His wiggle off the dribble naturally leads him to make a play either for himself or a teammate … Sexton’s jumper also looks promising, as he combines his ability to get to the rim with a variety of moves on the perimeter … He utilizes step backs, pull-ups, and even some mid range fallaways … He is a dangerous scorer in the mid range area, and even though that is not an essential part of today’s game, the best scorers all excel in this area … While not a pass first point guard, he has the prerequisite vision and playmaking ability needed to be an NBA floor general … He is a great facilitator in transition, and his ability to get into the lane in the half court allows him to collapse the defense and find open teammates all over the floor … His aggressive style combined with his explosiveness point towards high upside on the defensive end at the next level … Sexton also is not afraid of the big moment and does not back down from tougher competition … He plays with tremendous passion and seems to perform his best in big games … With his two-way skillset and determination, Sexton has a chance to be a quality lead guard in the NBA …","Sexton still has some room for improvement as a slasher despite his explosiveness … He has the ability to finish with his left hand at the rim but is obviously much more comfortable going right at this stage … He needs to add a bit more finesse to this department in his game, as he will not be able to rely on sheer athleticism once he reaches the NBA … His shot selection could also use some polishing … He tends to force the issue at times and often tries to make the flashy play instead of keeping it simple … While Sexton has proven to have excellent shot making ability, his balance on his jumper is not always consistent … He is more of a streaky shooter than a pure knockdown threat at this point … Sexton is much more of a combo guard than a true point guard, which could hinder his ability to run a team at the next level … His assist turnover ratio is below two to one, which is less than ideal for a lead guard in the NBA … He will need to develop into more of a facilitator to maximize his offensive efficiency at the next level … He also has a tendency to become a bit stationary without the ball in his hands, so his activity off the ball can improve …",74,185,19.47

Started off poorly on defense to start his college career, but has shown significant growth, especially in terms of staying in front of ball handlers … Looks to get out in transition when given the opportunity and runs lanes well for the most part, and looks to get to the rim … Rarely makes careless passes and doesn’t stagnate the offense by over dribbling … Moves well off the ball and uses off ball screens very well to create separation from defenders … Excellent catch and shoot player from midrange, especially along the baseline … Can shoot over most defenders and is not afraid to look for his own offense … When he needs to rebound, can rebound very well … Won’t turn 19 until August 11th. One of the youngest freshmen in college this season, and still has a lot of room to grow … Reason to believe that his game will develop … Has the potential to be a solid all around player that can do many different things …","Motor can run hot and cold, when engaged he is very good, but when not fully engaged he can disappear completely … His overall game can be affected by his shot, when the shot isn’t falling he can start to lose focus … Possesses poor court vision mainly due to keeping his head down when handling the ball, which can lead to turnovers and offensive fouls … Rarely passes the ball in transition, even if it results in him attacking the rim in a 3-on-1 situation … Will be at a speed and quickness disadvantage against small forwards at the next level … When the offense goes through other players, he will often coast instead of focusing on rebounding or defense … Has a tendency to force or settle for long shots instead of attacking defenders … Has only one move in the post, will need to develop his repertoire further to have success on the low block at the next level … Not a very efficient player, although some of that is because Kentucky’s reliance on him offensively, allowing defenses to key on him … Doesn’t have a noticeable killer instinct or edge to him, sometimes looks content to blend, instead of stand out despite having an immense amount of talent … Struggles at times to create his own offense as he has difficulty getting past opponents.",81,215,18.87

Miles Bridges,12,"It was not too long ago that a tweener type of player like Miles Bridges was difficult to find a distinct role in the NBA … Over the last couple of years though, the dynasty that the Golden State Warriors have built has transformed basketball into a positionless game where players like Bridges are now the pivotal role players to which every team wants to build themselves … A player like Bridges is perhaps the most important piece of this new positionless puzzle: a two-way wing player who can play multiple positions in various lineups … The intrigue with Bridges begins with his NBA-ready frame and incredible explosiveness … Bridges might be the draft’s top athlete, between his quickness, power and leaping ability … At 6′ 6"", 230 pounds, he’s built similarly to Jae Crowder or PJ Tucker … Like Crowder, he will also be an asset on the defensive end in today’s game because he can guard positions 2 through 4 … He’s quick enough around the perimeter to chase around guards with the strength to match up against bigger forwards … He’ll have the chance to be a tough one-on-one defender like Crowder, but Bridges, who blocked 1.5 shots a game at Michigan State, will also be an exciting defensive playmaker for his ability to chase down fast breaks and fly in from the weak side … Bridges will probably never be an elite offensive playmaker or shot creator, but his catch and shoot ability will at least make him a threat … Bridges connected on almost 38 percent of his threes in two collegiate seasons and also shot 85 percent from the free throw line as a sophomore … His lefty mechanics are smooth with little wasted motion, and he has good footwork and shot preparation before the catch … He also can get himself easy baskets with his athleticism off straight-line drives, cuts and in transition … He is also a deft passer at 3.6 assists per 40 minutes, and he also had a positive assist-to-turnover ratio at Michigan State … He has a solid feel for the game and does a nice job of making the simple play off of the catch and in pick-and-roll situations … Bridges is also a very high-level rebounder for a wing and uses his strength and athleticism to get involved on the glass on both ends … Bridges does not shy away from big moments and has proven to be a clutch player in late game situations … He is a very competitive player with a high motor on both ends of the court …","Bridges is not a great ball handler and can get sloppy with his dribble in the half court … He does not project as a primary ball handler or shot creator at the next level and is more of a one or two dribble player instead of a playmaker. Bridges is listed by Michigan State as 6-7, but his last official measurements had him at 6-6 with a 6-9 wingspan … The lack of height makes him undersized as a small forward and well undersized at the 4 … He also does not have ideal length, which may hinder his ability to be as disruptive as a defender in the NBA against longer and more athletic players … Despite his explosiveness, he does not get great lift on his jumper, which will generate questions about whether he will consistently be able to get his shot off against longer defenders in the NBA … Bridges is also somewhat limited by his lack of a pull-up jumper and mid-range game … The likelihood Bridges will develop into an offensive focal point who can create consistently for himself and others seems low … It’s not a role he played in either season for the Spartans, and most future wing creators tend to show flashes of this at some point in college …",78,220,20.27

Jalen Brunson,33,"Brunson is one of the most accomplished/successful guards to come out of college basketball in recent memory … This past season as a junior, he won his second national championship, earned AP Player of the Year honors and the Wooden Award … Brunson started 115 games at one of the top college programs in the country in Villanova and is an NBA-ready guard with great maturity and basketball IQ for the point guard spot … He was highly productive in his final season, averaging 18.9 points and 4.6 assists as a junior while shooting 52.1 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from the three-point line … There are very few questions about Brunson’s leadership/ intensity / and pure basketball skills … He is an outstanding leader on the court and makes everyone around him better … Brunson can score at all three levels and be a quality facilitator of the basketball as well … While lacking elite size and explosiveness for an NBA lead guard, Brunson has the skill and craftiness to somewhat make up for it … He has the full arsenal of moves on offense … He is left-handed, which is already more difficult to guard in and of itself because defenders aren’t as used to guarding them … Brunson also moves without the ball very well and cuts with purpose to look for angles where he might be open to catch a pass in open areas … He is excellent at advancing the ball with a sense of urgency to spark the break … He consistently has his head up early in the backcourt and is willing to skip the ball ahead to the open man in transition … Brunson also has a very strong fundamental game on the defensive end … His footwork is very good … He understands how to use his body … He is willing to play with physicality … He anticipates, sees the floor and understands how to play in the team defensive concept … With all of that said, Brunson will still have to prove that he can keep NBA point guards in front of him … He also protects the ball by shielding it with his body and by using his strength … Brunson plays with a steady pace, changes gears and directions very well and creates space by initiating contact, all of which helps when penetrating the defense to score or kick to an open teammate … He has very good court vision and the instincts to see and deliver pinpoint cross-court passes or cunning bounce passes to open cutters … Brunson’s strength and decisiveness allows him to finish effectively around the rim, too, and he makes use of jab-steps and pump-fakes regularly, often times making strong and creative drives to the rim while staying low to the ground before taking off and finishing the play when he’s created the right angle … Brunson is comfortable finishing with either hand and is crafty in transition … He regularly utilizes Euro-steps and other advanced footwork moves while attacking from smart angles to get a high percentage shot off …","The defensive end is where the most questions will arise for Brunson … In today’s NBA, most teams prefer to play lineups that are extremely versatile and switchable on the defensive end … It is far too easy for teams to force switches and get the match-ups they want … Brunson could be a liability in this regard if things go poorly … To be even more clear, Brunson projects as a player who can only defend one position, the point guard position, and it is not 100 percent clear that Brunson would be successful defending starting NBA point guards … The fact is that most players Brunson defends, even without getting switched on to wings or bigs, will be both bigger (longer) and faster than Brunson … While Brunson is an unselfish player, he has a tendency to at times over-dribble while probing the defense, which leads to turnovers … If he can develop a more consistent floater and pull-up mid-range jumper it would help to make decision making simpler while opening up angles to the rim while making him a more versatile scorer … The defensive end is where Brunson must make strides to prove to scouts that he hs what it takes to excel in the NBA … Brunson’s lateral quickness, effort, and willingness to contest shots left a lot to be desired, which is concerning considering his relative pedestrian physical tools … When projecting to the next level it’s necessary for Brunson’s stock that he proves to be a capable defender since he’ll have to stay in front of the best playmakers in the world at the NBA level …",74,200,21.82
Devonte Graham,34,"1st Team All-American selection, DeVonte Graham, is perhaps the most experienced college point guard in the draft field this season … A crafty scorer … Possessing a high quality outside jump shot, Graham shot .40% from deep as a senior, and sported three point percentages over 40% for three of his four years at Kansas … Devonte has shown the ability to shoot both off the dribble, and as a spot up shooter … Graham has consistently shown his capability to extend his range out past the NBA line as well … His long range shooting will certainly translate to the current NBA landscape … Graham is also well adept at running the pick, and roll and is excellent at throwing lobs in P/R situations … After playing off the ball much of his first three seasons, Graham showed he could really operate as a point guard during his senior season … His assists rose to 7.2 per contest, while still only turning the ball over 2.8 times per game … Devonte’s ability to control the game while being ball dominant paired with his experience playing next to high volume shooters such as Frank Mason, Josh Jackson, and Wayne Selden makes him a versatile option for an NBA franchise … He’s perfectly adept to helping his teammates shine, but as he showed his senior season, he has the skills to up his game when needed (17.2 ppg in 2017-2018) … At 6’2” and with a seemingly long wingspan for his height, Graham isn’t a large point guard, but he certainly is big enough to be considered solid sized for an NBA one … His defense was often overlooked, but is a heady player on the defensive end who can really make life tough for his opponent … In the NBA, he won’t be asked to carry nearly the offensive load he did at Kansas, and I feel he’ll be a capable NBA defender against the majority of NBA point guards … He tallied 197 steals while at Kansas, and has always been effective in the passing lanes due to his high overall basketball IQ … A competitor, who shows a willingness to challenge teammates to raise their level of play in big moments … Graham is a high quality leader, and individual, who is mature and ready to enter professional basketball from a personal standpoint …","Devonte Graham, while possessing decent size and length, is still a little thin for an NBA guard … Listed at 185 pounds, he could stand to add some strength … Athletically he’s average, showing good quickness, and the ability to get off the ground, but he’s not a standout by NBA standards … Could be taken out of games mentally if he gets frustrated … A poor shooting start in games potentially means he will stop looking for shots and instead look to distribute the ball instead … This strategy, while unselfish, often hurt the Jayhawks who at times struggled to find scoring during 2017-18 … Only shot .40% from the floor in his senior season, but this is more due to the massive offensive burden he took on for the Jayhawks … I suspect his shot selection will improve in the professional ranks when he’s not asked to do so much for his team … While showing improvement every season in college, Graham turned 23 years old in February and therefore is likely not to be viewed as a player with much upside left to develop … His age is likely to effect his draft stock …",73,185,23.34

Actually shot more FTs and 3 pointers as a sophomore … Level of competition in the American Athletic Conference leaves a lot to be desired, adding skepticism of how Frazier can perform on a regular basis against opponents with similar athleticism … His team’s lack of success (5-13 in conference) also makes it more of a challenge to accurately evaluate him … Must learn to play at a much higher intensity level in order to achieve similar success at the next level …",78,200,21.82

Rarely does he get too sped up or out of control when coming off of ball screens … Carr is a capable playmaker as well and has improved his assist to turnover ratio in his sophomore season … When he keeps his eyes up and does not try to force the issue, he has shown flashes of solid vision … Carr is a good free-throw shooter as well, at nearly 80 percent for the second season in a row … He his size and length, he has some defensive upside as well, despite not being the most explosive vertical athlete … If he can learn to become more active with his hands on the ball, he could be a guy that records a lot of steals and blocks … Carr is also a good rebounder for a lead guard, averaging nearly five boards per game in each of his first two seasons … He is also clearly not afraid of the big moment, as he made some big time shots late in games this season, most notably to beat Ohio State on the road and one to tie it regulation against Minnesota with time winding down …","Carr lacks elite burst off the dribble and does not always explode to the basket when he turns the corner … He is also not the most explosive leaper, which hinders his ability to finish at the rim at times … That will limit his defensive upside in the NBA, as he is not quite big enough to guard NBA two-guards, but he does not have the lateral quickness to consistently stay in front of the dynamic point guards that he will see most nights in the pros … Carr also struggles to score against more physical defenders … Despite having a solid 6-5 foundation to work with, he checks in under 210 pounds and can be pushed off his spots fairly easily, so he will need to add some strength at the next level … There are questions if Carr’s improved shooting may be a bit of a fluke … Mechanically, there are no glaring hitches to his release, but his ball does not have great rotation … Will he be able to get away with this behind a deeper NBA three-point line?

Jaylen Barford,-1,"Barford is a bulldog as a combo guard … A compact and sturdily built 6’2 player, he is not afraid of contact and projects as a tough defender … Made great strides as a shooter this past season, going from 26% to 43% from deep in only a season while nearly doubling his attempts … Has consistent mechanics and shoots with more confidence than previously … Projects as more of a spot-up shooter, but can make simple pull-up shots off the dribble … Decisive, does not really wasted time when the ball is in his hands … Adequate athletic ability…Plays a simple and effective game, prefers to go north and south on his slashes and is generally prepared to fire when he gets the ball on the perimeter with space and his feet set … Has the potential to be a good defensive player, and generally shows effort and physicality with his matchups … Lets the game come to him … Has a workmanlike type of approach as a player, not much flash but the type of player that a coach will appreciate…Helped his case by playing well in Portsmouth after the season …","Barford was mostly an off-ball player in college, and at 6’2 does not have much in the way of lead guard skills … Definitely more of a scorer than a playmaker for others, and does not have a natural feel for dictating the flow or pace of a game … Offers little length to compensate for his underwhelming size, and is nothing special in terms of explosiveness and quickness … Pretty bland skill set and lacks creativity, doesn’t particularly stand out in many areas at all … Ball-handling skills are average for a guard prospect…Not likely to be an efficient finisher around the rim against NBA-level competition …Will settle for contested jump shots too easily at times",74,205,22.42
Rob Gray,-1,"Gray was a highly entertaining and exciting college player … Prolific scorer in his 3 seasons at Houston (current all-time points leader in the AAC), showing some impressive shot-making skills with a good number of ways to get his shots off … No doubt he loves having the ball in his hands … Crafty offensively, understands how to set up ways to score … Looks to aggressively attack defenders, often keeping them on their heels and off balance … Will draw fouls on jumpy defenders, and has the physical strength and body control to convert through contact better than you may expect … Loves to shoot off the dribble, and can really be lethal when he does … Shows off NBA shooting range, and an adequate amount of crossovers to create space on both deep shots as well as his arsenal of floaters and scoop shots … Though not an explosive athlete, he can get to the rim some with his decent 1st step, and convert some tough shots at the rim and finish with either hand effectively … Competitive and confident player, definitely brings energy, a feisty attitude and toughness to the court … Played very well throughout the season for a good and athletic Houston team in the AAC, but was even better during the 2018 NCAA Tournament, scoring 62 points in 2 games … Instinctive, and makes more hustle plays than you’d expect from your leading scorer too …","Born in 1994, making him 24 years of age and limiting his upside … Gray, though he moderately improved in this area, is not a natural playmaker, so he has automatic position questions standing as a 6’1 scoring guard…Not a physically gifted player, and will be at an athletic disadvantage in the NBA as well…Is very ball-dominant, dribbles a lot and is never going to be in a situation in the NBA where he will be used anywhere near as much as he was in college … Can be a bit selfish, but to his credit sometimes it was necessary for his team to win … As with most “fan favorite” types of scorers, his shot selection at times can leave much to be desired…Will force some shots and gets himself into low percentage situations by sometimes being out of control off the dribble … Last resort passer, mostly looks to pass if he has no way to get his own shot…Does not project to be a more than an occasional pest on the defensive end against NBA guards…Not much of an above the rim player, would likely struggle to get to the rim and finish with any real regularity at the NBA level…OK pick and roll player and spot up shooter, but not a standout in either area…Overall efficiency is middling, with a 50% mark inside the arc and 36% 3 point percentage, with a 3 to 2 A:TO for his career…Doesn’t really fit on a team that doesnt play very up-tempo …",73,185,24.23
Allonzo Trier,-1,"Natural scorer (18.1 points per game) and capable of scoring in a variety of ways … Does a really good job of finishing and making tough shots around the rim … Can finish through contact … Runs the floor well in transition … Court vision is improving (2.7 assists per game in sophomore year; 3.2 assists per game in junior year) … Handles the ball well for a shooting guard … Has a pretty smooth release on his shot … Not a guy you want to leave open from 3-point range (38.0% last season) … Does a good job shooting off the dribble … Knows how to gain separation from defenders … Really good foul shooter, making opponents pay when he gets to the line (86.5%). Good form on his shot … At times, especially earlier in his career showed excellent explosiveness …","Needs to do a better job fighting through screens on defense … Tends to reach in a lot on defense without producing turnovers (.6 steals) … Loses his man too often … Lateral quickness on defense needs to improve … Needs to defend guys tighter and not worry about helping too much … Gives guys too much space … Needs to do a better of job of closing out shooters … Unclear if he can hang with NBA guards, especially point guards … Defensive IQ needs to improve … While he handles the ball well for a shooting guard, he doesn’t have point guard level ball handling … At 6’5”, 200 pounds, with a 6’7"" wingpsan, 8’2"" standing reach, Trier has just below average length and size for an NBA 2-guard and would really increase his value if he could run the point … His assist numbers are going up, but they’re still way too low for a point guard … Also needs to add weight and more physical strength … Got suspended to start the year for the use of banned substance … ""While capable of finishing through contact, he doesn’t really seek it … Physicality needs to improve … Needs to have a better nose for the ball (3.0 rebound per game) … Has drawn some critism for not being a team player, not always putting out the right body language and being supportive of teammates …",77,200,22.44

Bonzie Colson,-1,"Colson was a productive, matchup problem for a Notre Dame team that typically plays with the type of pace and spacing you’d see in the NBA … A cerebral player with a high skill level and all-around attributes, Colson is an undersized, overachieving combo forward in the mold of a PJ Tucker … An aggressive and physical player, who has the length (7 ft wingspan) and tenacity to defend players with much more size … Pretty strong … Outstanding rebounder for his size as well, displays great hands and definitely has a nose for the basketball … Has quick and nibble enough feet to take bigger players off the bounce when facing the rim…Makes hustle plays, and will compete and do the dirty work … Active, not the type to stand around with his arms out and his feet planted to the floor waiting for the ball…Adept at finding open spaces to cut to for baskets, shows the ability to be effective as a pick and roll scorer … Showed that he isn’t afraid to score around the rim or the high post, and owns a solid post game with some turnaround Js, up and unders and a quick jump hook … A unique type of scorer, if may not be glamorous every time, but he was a safe bet to get the job done offensively in college … Battle tested and experienced, had some good games against top competition throughout his career … Will be the type of player that home team fans love if he sticks on a roster","Comes with obvious size concerns, as a 6’5 225 combo forward whose game isn’t necessarily a safe bet to seamlessly translate … Though a versatile scoring threat in college, he will not likely be able to utilize his back to the basket post game nearly as frequently in the NBA at his size…Has some comfort making open jump shots, but he is not to be confused with a knockdown shooter … His ability to develop his shot and extend his range to the NBA line will be very important for him …Will force shots at times, not always a willing passer …Considering his size, it is imperative for him to be in proper position defensively against bigger players or he will be taking advantage of…Perimeter skills aren’t great right now … Will have to land in the right situation to establish himself in the NBA, but the positionless nature the current game makes his chances better … 2 injuries to the same foot that derailed his senior season are cause for concern, teams will have their eye on that",77,225,22.45
