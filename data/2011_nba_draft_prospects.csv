Kyrie Irving,1,"A “true” PG with a great feel for the game … Charismatic player with the imagination and mindset to become a standout PG at the NBA level , “has a chance to be special”… A facilitator who shows the ability to make those around him better … Great vision and passing skills … Great burst. Has the blow by speed to get past defenders off the dribble … Good decision maker. Looks to make the right play instead of always trying to dazzle … Doesn’t force shots or overdribble (improved this in his limited time at Duke) … Excellent shooter with the ability to get shots within the flow of the offense …  Jumpshot has great form … Has range out to NBA three and just needs time to gain consistency on it … Good one on one skills … Can pull up off the dribble … A strong finisher exhibiting good body control … Ambidextrous with the dribble, showing impressive ability to go to the left and finish with his off hand … Has excellent ball handling ability with a nasty crossover … High motor kid who gets strong reviews for his character and work ethic … Has a good wingspan and big hands which are obviously positive attributes … Very efficient shooter : 53% fg, 90% ft, 45% 3p … Solid defender with adequate size. Gets low, fundamental, doesn’t gamble too often. Plays the passing lanes well (1.5 spg) …","Durability is a legitimate concern after he missed all but 8 games of his freshman season (heading into the post season)  …  The big question is whether this was a fluke (turftoe injury) or indicative of a bigger problem … Lack of experience at the college level  is concerning considering how difficult it is to master the position at the next level … Could struggle with the transition to the NBA game with just 8 games of NCAA experience under his belt. Granted he looked advanced for a freshmen PG … Has solid athleticism, but not elite … Not known for highlight reel dunks or a player who overwhelms opponents with his physicality … Needs to continue to work on his strength in order to improve his ability to finish and defensively … Tendency to get out of control attacking the basket … Put up tremendous numbers in his first 8 games, however it’s questionable he would have sustained that for an entire season through conference play … Appears to have the total package but missing such a huge portion of his freshman season makes him a risk. A team will have to roll the dice on limited college experience and exposure …",75,191,19.26
Derrick Williams,2,"Williams’ production in his 2 years at Arizona were phenomenal, as he managed to improve on his excellent Fr. stats across the board … In terms of physical tools, Williams has very good size for a combo forward, boasting a very strong 6’9 248 lb frame with a long 7’1 wingspan added for good measure … Very fluid and smooth athlete, who also flashes explosiveness leaping off of 2 feet … A true matchup problem for defenders, Williams uses his strong footwork and soft touch to score the ball with very good effectiveness in the post or facing up … His shooting ability is good, as evidenced by his 57% 3-point percentage (albeit on a limited 2 attempts a night), and he uses it to keep his matchup honest so they can’t play off of him … Also functional from mid-range, as a threat to slash or shoot … One of the best isolation players in the entire draft, as PF’s have big trouble with his rangy first step and body control for a guy his size, and SFs are generally at a disadvantage in terms of their size and strength … Has an ease at which he creates shots from the PF spot that will continue to make him a big threat from that position, and his size is certainly adequate enough to play down low too … Fairly decisive finisher down low, who uses his wide lower body to seal in good position to get the pass and go up with shots before the defense collapses on him … Works hard moving without the ball, and isn’t indifferent to throwing his body in his man down low to establish very deep position … Although he’s not likely to seal NBA PF’s as much as he did in college, he also can post from mid-range and utilize quick spins and turnaround moves to use his dribble drive game to his advantage … Understands how to shield defenders using his body off the dribble … Strong finisher, who will at times slip free of the D around the rim and make emphatic dunks as a 2 footed leaper … Very capable finisher with both hands … Pretty easy shooting stroke with a soft touch and compact fundamentals that are very consistent … Pretty good offensive rebounder due to his quick 2nd bounce and solid motor, and will get high percentage shots every game due to this … Won’t take very many bad shots, which is a great sign due to the go-to role he embraced for 2 years … Got to the foul line a lot due to his ability to be a mismatch, shot an OK percentage (74%) once there, and this aspect of his game will very likely translate to the NBA as well … Super efficient, and scored 19.5 ppg on just 10 FG attempts a game … Ability to develop from a fairly unheralded recruit, to a surprisingly productive Fr., then to improve on a great Fr. season across the board as a Soph. speaks to his work ethic, and he still can make improvements on his weaknesses right now to continue to grow … Showed the ability to step up in big situations with kep plays to win games …","Considered a combo forward, and there are some questions about what position he will defend with the most effectiveness … Insists that he sees himself as a SF more than a PF, but he has never really played SF dating back to HS, and would certainly be a shaky defender against NBA SF’s … Hard to see him being as efficient and effective if he plays more SF than PF, although he certainly will be able to play some legit time on the wing … Was a pretty modest defensive player in college, as his lateral quickness is mediocre and his length is just OK, which are respective problems for the SF and PF positions … Definitely has wavering intensity on this end, and will allow baskets without much resistance around the rim, particularly against the bigger, more athletic PF’s he faced … Wasn’t that great a defensive rebounder (5.5 a game) and will ball-watch, and gives up rebounds on the defensive end that give offenses 2nd chance opportunities at times … Although he generally is decisive, Williams struggles at times with defenders crowding him and is pretty turnover prone when he gets collapsed upon … Doesn’t look to pass the ball very much … Saw limited minutes at times in games due to foul trouble … Won’t be a big threat in the passing lanes or blocking shots at the NBA level …",80,248,20.09
Enes Kanter,3,"Bigman with excellent size, strength and polish … Combines brute strength with a high skill level … Soft hands … Long arms and solid athleticism allow him to be a force in the paint … A tremendous rebounder.

Owns a diverse offensive game with the ability to use post moves and strength to score on his opponent or face the basket and knock down mind-range jumpshots … Has the strength to muscle through contact and finish … Smooth offensive game. Has a soft touch and excellent shooting motion … Good free throw shooter … Has legitimate center size. Measured 6-11, 261 lbs at the LeBron James Skills Academy in July … Possesses great dexterity and body control for a bigman … Coachable kid with a positive attitude and strong work ethic …","One of the big concerns scouts have with Kanter is his physical health. He has had a history of knee problems and there are concerns about his knees not checking out 100% when he has NBA physicals … Foot speed is good but not at the level of some of the top inside forces in the NBA … Played one year of high school ball at Stoneridge Prep in Simi Valley, California and was somewhat inconsistent …",83,259,19.1
Tristan Thompson,4,"A lefty post player with a tremendous wingspan … He has made improvements to his body, shedding the baby fat he carried throughout high-school, he has also added some mass and definition (his frame shows the potential to support even more weight without taking away from his explosiveness) … A good athlete, he is able to make plays on both ends of the floor thanks to his length, energy and blue collar approach… He establishes good early position and gets a high number of easy looks in transition thanks to his ability to run the floor … Battles for position and is able to get touches very close to the basket because he seals and counterseals extremely well … Has very good hands and makes difficult catches in traffic and on the move … Shows the ability to turn to both shoulders effectively and can finish with mini jump hooks with both hands  … He is becoming more comfortable using his body and quick feet to beat defenders to the spot …  He flashes the ability to faceup and attack off the bounce, but he will need to continue to polish his handles before he can fully utilize his quick and long first step … Finds the seams in the defence and gets to the openings for quick and easy finishes without having plays run for him … When his energy level is high he can be a very good rebounder, especially on the offensive end … He has an extremely quick second jump, and he is able to time his attack and get his hands on a high percentage of missed shots … His length also posses problems on the defensive end, as he is able to recover quickly or slide over from the weakside to block and contest shots around the basket …","At 6-9 he is a bit on the short side as a power forward at the next level … Although he has terrific length, and good athleticism, they do not negate his size issues completely … Also, at this point in his career he plays more as a center as his game is strictly confined to the low block … The major inadequacy that limits his game to the paint is the fact that his jumper needs serious work … He showed very little confidence in it all year and the ones he did take looked hesitant and were off-balance (he shoots with a major fade on almost every shot) … He shoots the ball over his head and extends the release too high, making his stroke very erratic and the results extremely inconsistent… To compound the issue, he shot an abysmal 49% from the foul line, raising the concern level on his outside touch even more … He needs to improve his back to the basket repertoire, adding counter moves once his initial drive gets cut off would benefit his game … Struggles against stronger defenders, can be bodied out of position and into off-balance shots … He is an inconsistent performer, his energy fluctuates drastically from game to game, and he doesn’t play with the same drive every night … Has disappeared in some big games this season … There is a strong correlation between his scoring and rebounding numbers, if he doesn’t get touches early in the game he will not look to get to the glass with the same aggressiveness on either end …  Born in 1991, he is a full year older than his class …",81,227,20.29
Jonas Valanciunas,5,"Lithuanian bigman with great size and rebounding instincts … Has a long 6’11"" frame and a huge wingspan to go along with it … Very fluid athlete … Runs the court well for a center … Good quickness and solid explosiveness/leaping ability … Strength/weight has been improving, and he should continue to add more in the future … Uses all of his physical skills to the fullest when attacking the glass … Extremely aggressive rebounder both offensively and defensively … Gets a lot of tip-ins and put-backs … Shows a good understanding of boxing out, which is somewhat rare for young players … Uses great length to either grab or tip out-of-area rebounds to teammates … Solid shot blocker with the potential to be very good in this area … Competes hard on defense … Length allows him to contest entry passes … Super active on both ends of the court … In the paint he shows a variety of developing moves … Has a nice jump-shot from 8-12 feet away from the hoop … Has great shooting mechanics and an extraordinarily soft touch for a bigman … Has a developing hook shot that could be deadly in time … Often used in pick and roll situations … Favorite move is to ""slip"" after setting up for a pick, and cut to the rim … Keeps the ball high and away from any secondary defenders … Incredibly efficient (shot 70.8% from the field in the Euroleague) … Doesn’t miss a lot of shots because he operates so close to the rim … If he doesn’t have a high-percentage shot he immediately passes the ball out … Remarkable free-throw shooter (88.5%) … Tough player that’s not afraid of contact … Just turned 19 and has a great deal of potential … Has a lot of enthusiasm for the game, and eager to improve. Unlike a lot of bigmen that were pushed into the game of basketball, it’s obvious he has a genuine love for the game …","Can’t create his own offense yet … Has a budding set of skills in the post, but needs teammates who can set him up … No real perimeter game … Almost all offense comes from around the hoop … Very unselfish but not a talented passer … Makes a lot of mistakes when trying to pass out of double teams … Plays very aggressively, which is a good quality, but it gets him in foul trouble quickly … Needs to learn how to play good defense without fouling … Hasn’t developed the habit of remaining stationary when setting screens … Struggles guarding stronger players … Still skinny, though he is showing progress in this area … Is currently signed with Lietuvos Rytas and the buyout option in his contract is over $3 million dollars, so he may not see the NBA for a few seasons … Very wet behind the ears.",83,240,19.14
Jan Vesely,6,"Possesses a terrific combination of size and length for the SF position … Offensively, he improved his low post game and is looking to post up more this year; he can post up smaller defenders and uses his height advantage to score over defenders; has a height/length advantage on almost every player in Europe … Jan has good motor and excellent ability to run the floor (most of his points are off of dunks, put-backs and points in transition) … Good hands around the basket … Facing up to the basket, he is able to get to the rim quickly due to his quickness and good first step. Very explosive off the floor when attacking the bucket and finishes strong … As a shooter he improved since last year and feels more confident taking shots outside the 3pt line and creating off the dribble; his mechanics and follow-through look fluid; good elevation on his shot … If he catches the ball and his feet are set and pointed towards the basket he usually will knock down shots … Defensively he is good, thanks to his length and can guard multiple positions … His lateral quickness is impressive for his size and he does a solid job at moving his feet (good P&R defender and closes well on the perimeter staying in front of guards) … Plays with lot of emotion … A competitive player that hustles for loose balls and brings energy on the court …","Vesely needs to continue improving his offensive skills. He’s still a work in progress as a player as his athleticism and ""wow plays"" exceed his effectiveness and consistency … He has had a decent season but more was expected from him coming into the year … He is limited to one or two dribbles when creating off the dribble and needs to improve his 1-on-1 game and ball-handling skills … Has to become more efficient/consistent shooter overall (50% FG, 46% FT, 46.3% 3FG in Euroleague and 74.1 % FG, 51% FT, 31.8% 3FG in NLB League) … Hasn’t added any weight since last year and will have to get stronger in order to compete in the NBA; still has trouble finishing plays under pressure … Has strength and athleticism but not productive enough as a rebounder (4.4 rpg in NLB League and only 2.9 rpg in Euroleague) … Could run into some problems fitting into an NBA position as his length slows him some on the perimeter in the half court set and he lacks the strength and toughness to play in the paint right now …",83,230,21.18
Bismack Biyombo,7,"A very explosive 6’9” center with a terrific wingspan … He’s able to run the floor with very good speed and hustles at all times … As he gains experience, his skills will certainly permit him to become a very solid defensive player, possibly a shot blocking specialist … Quickness and footspeed are surely good enough to defend inside players, hedge and recuperate on the pick and roll … Toughness and intensity are fine, balance is okay too, although as he gets stronger and adds volume it’ll be easier for him to hold inside positions and become a better finisher in the paint. Biyombo is a player who likes to play above the rim. Additionally he has nice skills in the low post to attack the basket, using fakes, spin moves and jump hooks … A quick first step and ability to put the ball on the floor allow him also to make one dribble power moves to the basket .. Appears to be a quick study, developing his skill level to the point where it is … There have been numerous African players who have been brought to European leagues and failed to accomplish what Biyombo has (impacting a high level ACB team) … As for rebounding, Bismack usually tries to box out and goes for offensive boards quite fiercely … In just a few months playing with the first team of Fuenlabrada in the ACB, defensive positioning in help side has improved a lot to become a consistent intimidating force in the paint … considered a high character kid by all accounts … Hands aren’t bad considering how raw he is and that many African players have below average hand eye coordination, and he could even develop into a pick and roll option.",Offensive game is a long ways from being NBA ready … He still needs to develop his footwork and overall awareness … Doesn’t have the needed confidence in his left hand yet and has to go right to finish inside. His outside shooting lacks polish … Right now his passing is only average … His general basketball knowledge and awareness on both sides of the court show his lack of experience … Fundamentals and timing on rebounds can improve … Several relatively basic concepts in both offense and defense aren’t yet automatic in his game … Too often loses rebounds by jumping in an uncontrolled fashion for blocked shots instead of keeping his inside position to box out his opponent …   Nico Van den Bogaerd 6/12/11,81,243,18.83
Brandon Knight,8,"Heady point guard with great size and explosive scoring ability … Very natural scorer with an effortless shooting ability and excellent instincts off the dribble … Very quick in half-court situations … Great first step … Penetrates the defense and gets into the paint with ease … Possesses a good-looking runner, which can be extremely useful for point guards at the next level … A fast runner in the open court … Makes good decisions in fast-break opportunities … Great size for a point guard, standing 6’3.25"" in shoes with a 6’6.75"" wingspan … Uses his length and solid athleticism to finish well around the rim … Looks comfortable with the ball in his hands … Creates shots well for himself … Uses a lot of hesitations and fakes to get himself open … Shoots the ball often and with confidence … Already has NBA three-point range … Likes to surprise the defense with a quick pull-up jumper just inside the arc … Doesn’t get rattled easily … Thrives in high-pressure situations … Had a reputation for being a clutch performer in high school and has certainly lived up to that at Kentucky (game-winners against Princeton and Ohio State in the NCAA tournament) … Unselfish passer who looks to keep his teammates involved … Good timing in pick and roll situations … Very smart defender that doesn’t gamble for steals a lot … Has the quick feet and long arms to stay in front of his man and deny penetration … Highly competitive and mature … Had a 4.0 GPA at Kentucky, which suggests that he is also responsible off the court … Only 19 years old with a strong work-ethic and a high upside … Will continue to improve …","Not a pure point guard … Ball handling ability needs a lot of work. His dribble is too high and will be easy to pick unless he improves upon it … Passing ability is respectable, but not intuitive … Very turnover prone, especially when trying to create for others … Gets caught trying to make ""home run"" passes at times, when a more conservative approach would save his team the possession… Efficiency leaves something to be desired … Only shot 42.3% from the floor… Very streaky shooter … Takes ill-advised shots, which aren’t really a problem when he’s hot, but can make you scratch your head if he wasn’t having a good game to begin with… Athletically, his leaping ability is fairly average… Isn’t a real threat to explode vertically or dunk on the defense … At 177 lbs, he’ll get pushed around by the stronger guards in the NBA …",75,177,19.57
Kemba Walker,9,"Walker’s game is marked by ""electricity"" and explosiveness. Plays with an undefinable burst, seemingly moving in warp speed while everyone else is standing still- yet he remains for the most part under control, with the ball on a string. Working in his favor is a freakish blend of raw speed, breathtaking quickness, ultra-aggression and sneaky power. Scores from anywhere on the court (23.5 ppg). Can’t be contained by a single defender off the dribble, be it in the half court or most notably in transition. Splits double teams and traps in a blink. Changes direction at FULL speed. He is a master at creating space, using jab steps, cross overs and pump fakes to shed defenders. Highly creative with the rock in his hands and finishing at the rim. Able to complete plays through contact with a full head of steam. Also able to re-adjust angles and avoid shot blockers by hanging and improvising in mid-air. Constantly in attack mode, frequently living at the charity stripe (7.7 attempts). Scoop shots and floaters are not foreign to his arsenal either. Overall shooting aptitude has improved dramatically since arriving on campus. His range shooting is now a real weapon (33% on 5.5 attempts), despite a myriad of low percentage, bail out chucks. He’s always been extremely comfortable shooting step back J’s off the dribble, but displayed a new wrinkle coming off screens as the season progressed. Solid elevation and high release. Tremendous two-footed leaper in space. Despite his gift for the putting the ball in the bucket, he’s very much a facilitator (4.5 apg), creating open shots for others by commanding a second/third defender. Prolific rebounder for his size (5.4 rpg), completely unafraid to mix it up with bigger bodies. Excellent lateral quickness with fluid hips. Beats the offensive player to the spot. Opportunistic defensively- if you’re careless with the ball, he’ll take it back the other way for a deuce (1.9 stl). His motor never runs low (38 minutes per). A true winner with a warrior’s spirit.","His measurement of 6’1 with shoes was a win, but he remains an undersized commodity, his standing reach of 7’7.5 is the same as 5’10 PG Isaiah Thomas. Defending the new breed of NBA point guards will be a severe challenge. He takes a ton of hits in his 184-pound frame, and while he’s been anything but fragile, it’s a concern over the long haul. Walker’s an unselfish distributor and a dynamic playmaker, but he’ll never be mistaken for an orchestrator or true lead guard. Connecticut’s half court offense was largely late clock isolations: can he get a team organized and operate an NBA style, functional system? Has a tendency to play out of control times, but to his credit he has learned to pace himself when the situation calls for it (2.3 turnovers). It’s difficult to cage a lion, and as a result he will go through patches where he gets caught up in the emotion of the game. Too many out of control shot attempts, attacking the trees wildly when there’s simply nothing available. Fearless is a great quality as long as it doesn’t reach the point of reckless. Criticizing him for lack of efficiency (43% fg) is probably unfair given the tremendous burden placed upon his shoulders. Nevertheless, he does have a tendency to waste possessions. He finished in traffic at the collegiate level, but the NBA paint is a different animal. Continued advancement in the mid-range, pull up game will go a long ways in getting more quality looks and saving his body. Shooting stroke needs fine tuning, particularly from range. Arc on his jumper brings rain and inhibits consistent results.",73,184,21.14

His lack of elite athleticism gets exposed in the transition game … Lacks great foot speed which inhibits his ability to take the ball off the dribble against quick defenders … Recevied a one game suspension due to a marijuana possession charge, but scouts don’t seem too concerned about that therefore it hasn’t affected his stock much … Long, athletic defenders can give him trouble …",79,206,21.38

Mechanics on his shot break down when he shoots from outside 15 feet. Sort of pushes the ball instead of shooting it in one fluid motion. Actually shows better mechanics when shooting moving towards the basket than when on balance and going straight up … Midrange game also lacked consistency, shooting too many off-balance jumpers off the dribble … Will need to adjust playing primarily off the ball with less opportunities to dominate the ball… Vulnerable defensively in one on one situations against smaller, quicker guards",78,193,19.94

Nikola Mirotic,23,"A 6’10” forward with potential. Actually the potential has already become a reality this season with Real Madrid, one of the traditional powerhouses and present at the recently played Euroleague Final Four. A good frame  … Yet he shows good balance, mobility and also a very nice wingspan … He’s got pretty good hands and a soft shooting touch, offering good reliability from beyond the arch up to the foul line. Shot selection is really excellent … He’s also willing to take the big shots to help win games … Might not be the quickest shooter, but his release and rhythm are good and he can create shots off the dribble when necessary. Able to score from the outside, able to penetrate and also a skilled low post player with a variety of moves … He handles the ball well with both hands for a guy of his size, and often helps to dribble the ball up court when the guard is being overplayed. Offensively Mirotic is tremendously versatile. Even if he’s missing better strength and athleticism, a good first step and very controlled drives gets him to draw many fouls. Adding to that a very high basketball IQ, good court awareness and anticipation, which allows him to make very quick decisions once he receives the ball. Spin moves (including over baseline foot), left and right up and unders and jump hooks, turn around jumpers, 45 degrees bank shots and shotfakes all form in a natural part of his repertoire. And he’s a reliable finisher inside. Apart from scoring himself, he contributes in the functioning of his team by making the ball move around on the perimeter. He also knows how to post up, seal off his position and maintain it. Being a good passer with an even better court vision enables him to find his teammates from the low post or out of dribble when driving towards the basket. In offensive rebounding he continuously tries to find a good position, often succeeding follow ups or at least getting touches to obtain a new possession. Defending pick and roll isn’t an issue either, considering his physical assets to hedge and recuperate as required. At this point defensively he can be matched up with both small and power forwards. Not a great shotblocker in the way of a top leaper who goes for each shot, nonetheless he manages to block a fair share of them due to very good help side positioning, timing and awareness.","Even though agility and leaping are just average, surprisingly he’s quite quick off his feet and is able to run the floor well when he puts his mind to it … Over the years, there have been moments where a lack of motivation and concentration affected his running effort and activity on offense … Overall I would catalogue his athleticism as just okay for NBA standards … Has a good frame but will need to add additional strength … He is a better set shooter than creating shots for himself … He’s much more effective in half court offenses than in one on one fastbreak situations. When he’s on the receiving end in pick and roll plays, he mostly steps out the 3 point line and continues just occasionally inside. Even though he usually does box out and picks up defensive rebounds, rebounding is an aspect that he can still improve significantly. Whereas he can successfully defend speed (in Europe), against power it’s a lot more complicated. He’s unable to stop somebody who takes him one on one to the basket, as his body lacks the strength to contain many players …",82,225,20.38

Out of control at times and casual with the rock. Prone to getting stripped, putting the ball down in congested areas (2 to). Releases his jumper on the way down, resulting in line drive trajectory.

Hes more comfortable defensively playing in the paint, because his lateral foot speed is just above average, and his leaping ability is so good. Hes good at cleaning up rebounds because of his athleticism and hang time.","Aguilar has a nice offensive game but you cant count on him to carry the scoring load because while hes talented and experienced at a young age, he isnt always consistent. He relies too much on the fall-away jumper and doesnt have many other offensive moves. He also favors his right hand when dribbling and prefers to try to out-jump his defender rather than use his left hand to score around the basket. Its unclear if hes a power forward or a small forward for the NBA/Euroleague. He cant guard the NBA three on the perimeter, and he doesnt have the muscle in his skinny frame to bang down low. He also doesnt have the ball handling ability to play the 3 in the NBA. The position concern regarding Aguilar is a legitimate one.",81,200,22.38

Steven Gray,-1,"Gray, a 6’4 SG with a nice frame, is a nice offensive player with quite a jump shot … Very smooth and soft touch and a quick release … Looks pretty good coming off screens and is excellent moving with the ball…Plays with good confidence and isn’t afraid to let the ball fly … Impressive range … When he gets in the lane, will show some nice touch and ability to create space to get his shot off using his nice size and some fakes…Possesses nice passing skills, and is very good at finding open shooters … Likes to handle the ball around the 3-point line and is capable of orchestrating of running an offense from there in spurts … If the rest of his game and focus can improve, the NBA always has room for elite level shooters which he can become …","Gray lacks focus and intensity … Doesn’t fully display his athleticism and struggles to finish around the rim against athletic frontlines …  Possibly struggles even more to beat his man off the dribble … Doesn’t play very good defense at all, and lacks urgency in a large way on this end … Not rare to see him make lazy closeouts on shooters, or get beat off the dribble badly by slashers … Plays a bit upright … Looks uncomfortable handling the ball when crowded by his defender … Can struggle to produce when he can’t simply shoot over defenders … Not very quick and can be fairly predictable with the ball in his hands … Won’t be a slashing threat against the athletic defenders he’ll face in the pros … Started the season hot, but struggled to make and get shots against the more athletic teams he played … After shooting at an elite rate as a Fr., he regressed and never reached that level again at Gonzaga …",76,210,22.22

Jacob Pullen,-1,"Pullen is coming off a very impressive year after leading his #2 seeded Wildcats to the Elite 8 of the NCAA tournament … Pullen relies on a balanced outside game – Shows excellent rhythm in the catch and shoot with NBA range and looks just as comfortable pulling up off the dribble … Though he didn’t play the point guard role exclusively in his first few seasons, he’s shown that when he does break down the defense he can hit the open man for a layup or dunk … He attempted almost 7 free throws per game, an impressive number for a 6 foot tall guard … Shows body control when having to finish in traffic in the paint … Defensively he has very quick hands as an on ball defender, picking the pocket of many guards he faces averaging almost 2 steals per game … Improved considerably as a shooter in his junior year …","Pullen’s obvious obstacles revolve around his physical limitations … He stands at only 6 feet tall, and lacks explosiveness, quickness and athleticism compared to NBA caliber guards … He’s definitely not a pure point guard, lacking advanced ball handling skills and playmaking abilities … At his height with his quickness, or lack there of, he must show scouts this season that he has the ability to run the point and be a playmaker … Most of his 19 points per game came from the outside last season, which displays his inability to be effective getting to and finishing at the rim … Between his average ball handling and a somewhat low release on his jumper, it will be tough for Pullen to create open looks for himself against better defenders at the next level … Defensively his quick hands won’t be as effective against better guards, and his lack of height, length, strength and quickness will make it very difficult to guard 1s or 2s in the pros …",72,194,21.63

Alex Tyus,-1,"Athletic and energetic defensive-minded forward who plays with high energy and is able to make a contribution by finishing around the basket and by rebounding the ball…Tenacious and annoying defender to the point where he tries to bother his matchup and get under their skin…  Good athleticism and quickness for the power forward position in the NBA; runs the floor well and has some hops to his game… Good lateral quickness allowing him to stay in front of his man on defense… Long arms, with a near 7-foor wingspan, despite being only 6’7, will allow him play power forward on the next level… Very active rebounder; average 6.2 boards in 25 minutes per game, nearly 10 per 40 minutes…  Uses his long arms to block shots and get a hand in his man’s face… High energy, high motor type of player; infectious player, who brings energy to the entire team… Relatively good strength (lower and upper body) despite being thin… Tough-nosed player, who doesn’t back down…","No real offensive game… His scoring repertoire is strictly limited to dunks and finishes right at the rim because of his poor touch and because he has almost no ability to create with his back to the basket… Scores most of his points off of garbage baskets… no ability to play the small forward position (offensively) at the NBA level… Undersized for the power forward position at 6’7… Definition of a tweener… Had better stats as a sophomore than as a senior; didn’t drastically improve his game over his collegiate career…  Not a good shooter; shot 63% from the charity stripe and 50% from the field, despite scoring mostly off of garbage baskets… No offensive perimeter game… Averaged less than a block and half a steal per game; not great for someone trying to make the NBA purely off of defensive-ability…Elliot Grossman  6/21/11",80,207,23.47
