Brandon Ingram,2,"Wingspan, wingspan, wingspan, Ingram is all arms right now (measured 6’9.5"" in shoes and a 7’3"" wingspan at the 2015 NIKE Hoop Summit) … Uses his length well to finish at the rim … Plays the game very efficiently … Makes a high number of midrange jumpers … His shooting ability is his standout talent … Range extends to the NBA three point line … Uses size and length to easily shoot over smaller defenders … Good with head fakes to get his defender in the air on the perimeter … Effective at attacking the basket in a straight line … Length and long strides make him a hassle to keep out of the paint … Doesn’t need more than one or two dribbles to attack the basket … Despite lacking strength, he can get to the free throw line at a high rate … Comfortable with the ball in his hands and playing off the ball … Due to his size and length he’s able to see over the defense to distribute the ball … Delivers the ball on target to open teammates … Has a high basketball IQ, good attention to detail …","Extremely frail, weighed 196 lbs at the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit … Needs to develop his body and strength in order to handle the physical play at higher levels … Not a strong defender yet … Doesn’t possess great lateral quickness … Often out of place on the defensive end … His footwork when defending on the ball is subpar … Needs to become better at using his left hand, both when dribbling or finishing around the basket … Not an overly explosive athlete … While he plays smoothly, can seem to be playing too slow at times or even come across as lazy … Can develop into a better playmaker … A shy, low key kid, should look to develop into more of a vocal leader …",81,195,18.82
Jaylen Brown,3,"Wing with great physical and athletic tools with potential on both ends of the floor … Very long, near 7-foot wingspan with fantastic strength, and explosiveness that help his readiness for the league greatly, plus provides something to build on going forward … Has ability to finish plays above the rim and through contact … Quick reaction and a solid nose for the ball, can overpower other wings … Ball skills are quite workable, has ability to create some off of the dribble, in space … Built to run, showed ability in transition and can be dangerous off the defensive rebound … Has potential to be a nice combo forward in the current NBA, could be a mismatch in small ball, would punish slower defenders … Gets to the foul line quite often, not at all afraid of contact and is aggressive driving to the basket … Shooting mechanics are not broken and he certainly has some confidence as a shooter, plus an ability to develop as far as creating offense for himself … Has some definite dexterity and potential as a defender, really strong body control and agility that is rare given his size … While he is not much as far as creating for others, did average 2 apg and could do more as a passer in time … Has improved his shooting over time and while there is still a long way to go, he has gotten much better as opposed to being considered somewhat of a non-shooter in HS … Not a bad rebounder, especially on the defensive end … Conditioning is very solid, has energy and will be able to sustain minutes right away","Shot selection was definitely an issue, would settle for jump shots far too often and still was not very consistent from long range … Come comprehension isn’t up to speed yet, the guards around him didn’t make life easy … Long known to have issues turning over the ball, his hands have been questioned, can lose the ball in traffic and will bring the ball low to often … While he does have a chance to lead the break, will probably be better suited to learn to play more off of the ball … For all of the physical tools he possesses, would be beneficial to develop a post game and maybe some back-to-the-basket moves to take advantage of defenders in small ball … Loses focus on both ends, this will need to be addressed as far as his defense at the next level … Working on his off hand will be crucial … His spot-up shooting was quite inefficient, lacked consistency on a game-to-game basis … While he has potential in isolation scenarios, struggled in college in one-on-one, not particularly creative off of the bounce and could be forced to take difficult shots … Could definitely look for teammates a bit more, let the game come to him rather than force the issue … Can certainly improve as an offensive rebounder, with his size and athletic ability this would be key to him being a small ball 4 … Got in foul trouble pretty often, averaged 3.2 fpg and with turnovers also at 3.1 topg, will need to go through maturation to keep receiving meaningful minutes from the start … As much as he struggled from long range at Cal, going to NBA three-point range will be that much more difficult",78,225,19.68
Dragan Bender,4,"Versatile player, who can play both forward positions and occasionally at Center, although for now is considered a power forward … Has all the necessary elements to become a prototypical stretch 4, if he continues to improve … Impressive size for a power forward.

Kris Dunn,5,"Fantastic size for a PG with quickness and athleticism to go along with it, was incredibly potent on both sides of floor with potential to translate as a two-way player at NBA level … Athleticism and strength should help him get playing time right off the bat, plus his size gives him added versatility … Has a chance to be able to defend either guard position, great feet and instincts as an on-ball defender … Averaged 2.5 spg in 2016, 2.7 spg in 2015, with this ability being seen as one of the more translatable across levels of basketball … Definitely can get out and run, while also showing an ability to run pick-and-roll … One of the premier playmakers in college basketball, asked to do a lot for his team offensively and has skill at getting teammates involved … Has shown some ability to use his size and quickness on offense as well … Good nose for the ball, strong rebounder for a guard and very aggressive … Ability to get into the paint is there, can create off of the dribble and has an explosive first step … Improved quite a bit as an outside shooter, took a greater volume of three-pointers and shot a better percentage at 37.2% his final year … Conditioning is solid and also apparently checked out well as far as his past injuries","Has been known to play out of control, was quite turnover prone … Had a 1.77:1 assist-to-turnover ratio, not an ideal number for a college PG, much less an NBA PG … Still quite inconsistent as a jump shooter, seen as someone you can play off of and force to take low efficiency shots … Offensive game still has a long way to go, for as athletic as he was, one might have expected him to be a more high volume scorer at Providence … Struggled greatly jump shooting from every level, he needs to work on shot selection and on developing a floater or moves closer to the hoop … Not incredibly efficient in iso scenarios, needs to work on finishing at the basket … Had a bevy of injuries that came along during his college career, including two shoulder injuries that caused him to miss almost the entire 2013-14 season … Already 22-years old, some have wondered whether he may be ahead of certain players in the draft due to his age, and question his potential …",76,220,22.28
Buddy Hield,6,"Very rarely do players improve dramatically between their junior, and senior years of college, but Oklahoma senior, Buddy Hield has taken his game to the next level during his 4th collegiate season … Always a strong outside shooter, Hield has improved his 3 point percentage to a lofty .523% on 7.9 attempts per game … He showcases NBA range, and even beyond, rendering him a player that needs to be guarded out to 26 feet away from the hoop … Through 19 games this season, he’s scorching the nets to the tune of 53% from the field, 53% from deep, and 90% from the stripe, and he reportedly shots between 500-700 jumpers a session outside of Oklahoma’s practices, which is an attribute to his work ethic and desire to improve … Early in his career, Buddy showed great promise off the dribble, and as a slasher, but during his sophomore and junior seasons, he became a bit predictable and took over half his shots from beyond the arc … He’s clearly addressed this, and both improved his handle, and his at the rim conversion rate this season … He made just 55% of his shots at the rim last season (according to hoop-math.com) and has risen that to 63.3% this season … He also gets to the free throw line 1.7 more times per game … Buddy’s handle is noticeably better, and this has been in aid in both creating for himself, and for others … He’s also shown the ability to dribble out of trouble, change speeds, and get past defenders … Buddy’s averaging a career high in assists (2.5) as well … Since Buddy is 22 years old, there has been no physical growth since my scouting report last year, but his 6’8.5’’ wingspan is still a nice metric for a player who stands 6’4.5’’ in shoes, and his conditioning is clearly at an elite level, which was noticed at in the knock-down, drag out triple overtime game vs Kansas, in which Hield hung 46 points, pulled down 8 rebounds, and dished out 7 assists … From a defensive standpoint, he is very solid considering the offensive load he carries for his team … He’s willing, has quick hands, and has amassed 27 steals and 10 blocks in 19 games … Looking towards the NBA, he may not project as an elite defender, but he’s more than physically capable … He’s quietly averaging a career high in rebounds (5.8) and has actually logged 8 or more rebounds 5 times this season.","Buddy’s main knock will be his height for an NBA shooting guard, and although he’s improved his handle significantly in order to become more of a combo guard, he’s still not more of an undersized 2 … Buddy handles the ball a lot, and carries a great offensive burden for the Sooners, as a result he can be turnover prone at times (10 TO’s vs Oklahoma State) … Buddy has clearly worked to improve his game off the dribble, and now takes less than 50% of his shots from deep, in favor of driving to the hoop to keep defenders guessing … In reality, this is a player who has clearly worked very hard at not just what he does well, but his flaws, and as a result, he’s become a very complete player, that’s hard to nitpick outside of some physical differences between the size of NCAA players and those in the NBA …",77,215,22.53
Jamal Murray,7,"A very polished and clutch performer for his age … Murray is a combo guard, but in a good way, at 6’4″ and 207 lbs he possess the size to play both guard positions … Has shown the ability to play off the ball as a freshmen at Kentucky … Has three point range that must be respected by his defender … Takes open driving lanes when he sees them … Can really attack defenses when going downhill … Comfortable finishing in the lane and has a variety of shots to finish in the paint … Uses his athleticism to be a creative finisher around the rim … Thrives in the clutch. Not afraid of the big moments or the big stage … Plays with a calming presence at all times … Never seems rattled or off his game … NBA-level athlete that will pose a problem for opposing point guards in the league … A natural scorer (currently averaging better than 18 PPG) … Makes putting the ball in the basket look effortless … Moves well without the ball … Very good in catch and shoot situations … Possesses the ability to get hot from deep (shot 8/10 from three against Florida and 7/9 from three against Ohio State) … Shoots a lot, but has a true shooting percentage of 55.2% … Above average rebounder on the defensive glass for a combo guard (almost 6 RPG per 40 minutes)","Hasn’t played with the ball as much as anticipated, and not playing much PG in college games isn’t developing his skill at the position … The doubts about his ability to play full time PG could cosh him a few draft positions … In limited situations looks timid with the ball when not attempting to score … The tools and effort are there for Murray to be an above average defender, but will often lose focus off the ball … Will gamble for steals and hurt the team defensively … Might be the role Calipari is asking him to play, but looks like he would be a score first point guard at this stage of his development … Not much of a playmaker for others (averaging only 2.3 assists per game) … Can become too dependent on his outside shot in games (3/12 against  Tennessee, 1/10 against NJIT, 2/9 against Eastern Kentucky) … High volume shooter (averages 15 shots a game) … Too turnover prone, especially for an off guard, with 2.6 turnovers per game and a turnover rate of 13.6% … Doesn’t have outstanding length with only a 6’6.5″ wingspan … Can he blow by NBA level athletes consistently and keep defenders from crowding him …",76,205,19.34
Marquese Chriss,8,"A freakish athlete, arguably the most explosive frontcourt player in the draft and one of the best overall … Runs the court like a deer and explodes without having to put effort into organizing his feet … A highlight waiting to happen … Very nice shooting stroke and touch … Can knock down midrange shots and even shows the ability to extend out to college 3 point (hit 35% making 21 of 60 attempts on the year) … Improved in his ability to create shots for himself … Shows good ability to face up and use the dribble to get to the rim … Plays with good intensity and energy … Shows a lot of potential as a defender with his length, frame and quick feet … Has a quick first step, which he used to burn bigs when they were forced to defend him away from the basket … His sheer speed makes him difficult to contain on the block. Does a good job of creating separation from defenders and then exploding past them in the post … Utilizes a developing righty hook, as well as a turnaround jumper when posting up … Needs to add some strength and toughness but actually has very good size and muscle for a player his age. Appears that he should be able to carry additional weight without any problem … 39.9% on 2 point jumpers is very solid, all things considered … Utilized his length well to register 1.6 blocks per game and shows some solid timing, when he is patient … Will turn 19 in July, so his age suggests he has a lot of potential left to develop …","His low rebounding output is the first thing that scouts mention when dissecting his game. Considering his physical gifts, 5.4 rebounds per game should be higher, even at 25 minutes per game … He needs to work on becoming a better rebounder, both his fundamentals and effort level … He tends to just use his athleticism and doesn’t seem to have basic fundamentals in boxing his man out and holding position (something that works okay against college guys but won’t work against pros) … Feel for the game is still raw … Plays a little out of control on both ends of the floor … Low basketball IQ, especially defensively at this point and doesn’t anticipate well … Lacks focus and discipline defensively, too often bites on pump fakes, leading to foul trouble … Averaged 4.1 fouls per game, and fouled out of an astounding 15 games this year, including six in a row during Conference play. It’s no wonder why he played under 25 minutes per game, he was in foul trouble in virtually every game … Often tries too hard for the steal or block and doesn’t stay in a defensive stance … He’s then forced to chase down his man and over-extend, resulting in fouls on reaches or block attempts … Plays a little too upright, on both ends, but particularly on the defensive end … Too often finds himself out of position for help defense and on rebounds … Has good lateral speed but no one in their right mind would confuse him for a small forward … Maturity level was questioned as a freshman as he could be taken out of his game by bad calls or poor performance and it would show in his body language and interactions with refs … If he’s not dunking the ball, he struggles some in finishing on the move … Some may question his level of competition and the fact that he wasn’t more highly regarded out of high school … Should be able to improve upon his 68% FT shooting … Should also look to attack the basket and draw fouls more often than he did … Needs to cut down on his turnovers, 2.0 is a lot considering his minutes …",82,235,18.99
Jakob Poeltl,9,"There are not many 7′ footers who can run the floor like he does … He gets up and down the court very well, giving strong effort on every possession … Often gets himself open just by out-hustling opposing bigmen … He has an long, agile, and strong body, and enjoys contact and doesn’t back down from it … His skill level is still very raw but he has big, soft hands, and knows how to use his large frame to get deep post position and present good angles … Shows the ability to finish with both hands, and his soft touch gives his offensive game some real intrigue … His ability to finish around the rim allowed him to shoot with very high efficiency numbers from the field this year … Another very intriguing aspect of his skillset is how well he moves his feet on defense … He shows great coordination and can really show hard on the pick and roll without getting beat easily by guards … He plays really hard every minute on the floor, has a good motor and seems to understand his limitations … Needs to add some strength, but has an excellent frame to carry weight …","Despite being very young and showing a lot of ability, it’s possible that his ceiling isn’t quite as high as some believe … While he’s got a great attitude and appears very coachable, there’s skepticism whether he has the swagger to take his game to a star level … At the moment he doesn’t have any post moves to create for himself or be major a threat offensively and his free throw shooting was amongst the worst of any draft prospect … It begs the question of how big an impact he will be on the offensive end, and also without teammates creating for him … Defensively he should look to become a little nastier in pushing people around on the block … At this point his skills as a rim protector are underdeveloped, and it may never be a strength to his game … While he is really good at bodying people up and blocking shots on ball, he needs to learn how to contest shots coming from help side as well as being better against guards driving to the rim … Overall Poeltl has certainly made the best of his year and deserved the hype considering how fast he developed … Though his developing a real post game remains a questionmark, and that could always keep him away from becoming a high level NBA center …",85,240,20.7
Thon Maker,10,"Legit 7-footer with a huge frame who plays the game with energy and shows an intriguing combination of ball skills and ability to run the floor … Shows some signs of being able to stretch the floor, can make shots off the catch and has range out to high school three-point line … Competitive kid who despite lacking strength, does not shy away from contact and has the ability to keep possessions alive as a rebounder or cover space defensively … Has had a lot of experience on the wing and has handled the ball a lot during his career up to this point … While he is not the most fundamentally sound rebounder, has often contributed on the glass at both ends of the floor, certainly has the will to fight for boards … With solid length and reach, has the ability to effect shots around the basket, good weak side shot blocker and displays timing to block shots … Has experience on the AAU circuit and HS ball and seems to be in good condition, along with being quite coachable … Has a reputation as a hungry, driven player, who should put in the hours to maximize his potential … Has impressive ability to handle the ball in open space for his size, though that may not be utilized much at the next level… A willing passer who displays some above average court vision … If he adapts to rim-running, playing without the ball and can gain strength, he should be able to carve out a role in the league … Has shown some ability to make hooks with both hands, and also utilizes fade away jumpers that can be difficult to defend if he can master it … Agility at his size is solid, makes some off balance shots that can be difficult to stop … Strong free-throw shooter who got to the line at a solid rate at the HS level … Did a good job of bulking up his arms and shoulders over the past two years …","Despite garnering a ton of hype throughout his HS career, there is a sense that he has been intentionally hidden from NBA draft evaluators … While the combine exhibited his high level run/jump ability, he really struggles to explode when he meets contact … His legs and core have always been a concern, as he measured at 216 lbs at the NBA Draft Combine after measuring at 218 lbs during the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit, and without noticeable change as far as adding muscle to his upper body … There is a sense that what you see is what you get in terms of his body and any additional weight could slow him down or put pressure on his legs that they may not be able to handle … He gets knocked off balance easily, and has had a lot of trouble establishing himself in the post against stronger defenders … Has played on the perimeter so much that getting used to playing his more natural PF position will likely be a major adjustment, especially physically … Has definite lapses as far as defensive awareness … Lateral quickness is not to the point that he can defend NBA wing players, squashing any notion that he can be a 3 … Reaction time to plays on both ends can be slow at times, will bobble passes and let his man get behind him more often than you would like … While he is known for his handle, when he pushes the ball in the open floor it often leads to turnovers, and that asset probably won’t translate to the NBA … While in the post, has a bad habit of bringing the ball down low, leading to strips and effecting his shot, and also not lead to not drawing as many fouls as he drew at the HS level … While he has played against a national schedule for years and done well in some marquee match-ups, it’s incredibly difficult to evaluate a player who did not play in college or Europe, as we saw a large range of for high school players back when it was commonplace due to the huge amount of risk … Had a tough time at the Hoop Summit when matched-up with Skal Labissiere, whose struggles this season may cause people to wonder just how much further Maker has to go as well … Post defense will likely be a big issue, could be someone who has to deal with foul issues early on … Does not have the quickest release, plus will need to work on his overall consistency as an outside shooter … Shot selection will have to change quite a bit, will be interesting to see how he adapts … Lacks much of a low post repertoire, and the physical play in the paint will probably be a giant hurdle for him  …",85,215,19.34

Cheick Diallo,33,"When comparted to other 6’9’’ players, Diallo has both terrific end to end speed, and a motor to keep him going. His stride is both effortless, and his constant effort re-affirms all the ravings about his motor dating back to his high school days. These traits make Diallo a transition threat as a big man, and also aid him as a chase down shot blocker in the open court. Cheick also has good length. Sporting a 7’4’’ wingspan and a 9’1’’ standing reach (according to the 2015 Hoop Summit) he sizes up pretty favorably for an NBA 4 man. While probably not an elite leaper, he gets off the ground very quickly, and is easily a good jumper for a 6’9’’ player. Transitioning his length and athletic ability to the NBA should not be an issue with continued physical maturity. He has great timing as a shot blocker, especially from the weak side. Despite limited minutes as a freshman, Diallo blocked 4.2 shots per game per 40 minutes, and actually would have done so without projecting to foul out (3.7 fouls per 40 minutes). He possesses a knack for rebounding the ball despite not always being in the best position. Cheick’s per 40 minute rebound numbers would come right in at 13.3 per game. His long arms, really aid in his ability to grab misses on the defensive end. He also showed the ability to finish strong around the hoop, and good hands catching alley oops. It should also be noted that despite a season in which he probably tallied a lot fewer minutes than he expected, Cheick was an engaged player off the bench, and showed positive body language and overall team support when his minutes began to fade during Big 12 play.","Cheick’s decision making offensively is really far away from being much of an asset at the NBA level. His usage percentage was 21.7% was 2nd only on the team to Perry Ellis’ 25.5% and Diallo only dished out 1 assist on the season to pair with 17 turnovers. Despite sporting a good overall FG% (54.7%) his shot selection showed he had little grasp of the flow of the game, and good ball movement. He was also prone to lazy passes due to lack of adjustment to the offensive speed of college basketball. He can hit a 15 footer at a decent clip, which is a positive sign for his shot development, but he’s got a bit of a hitch in his shot movement that would benefit him if he corrected. Diallo must also continue to hit the weights, he’s not ready for a major NBA role next season, but has a nice frame to add muscle.

Wayne Selden,-1,"After two average seasons of collegiate basketball, Wayne Selden Jr. finally put together the kind of year many had believed he was capable of since he came out of high school. Wayne began to use his NBA positional size, which includes a 6’10’’ wingspan and a well-muscled 230 pound frame to finish at the rim. Selden shot a very impressive 71.3% at the rim (according to Hoop-Math.com) and many of his finishes were jaw dropping dunks while taking contact from defenders. As a sophomore, Wayne’s at the rim FG% was just 50%, so this massive jump was more of a mindset change, than any massive physical improvement. He also showcased more consistency on his jump shot, especially from deep where he shot .392% from 3 point range on 5 attempts per game. Selden has the size, and athletic ability to get his shot off at the NBA level, so this added consistency from deep will bode well on his next level roll. He’s also shown the ability to hit rhythm jumpers off the dribble from the mid-range, especially at the top of the key. While not a point guard, Selden is also a creative passer, and above average ball handler for a shooting guard. His 100 assists as a junior was a career high. Selden has the ability and desire to guard shooting guards and small forwards in the NBA. While he may struggle a little bit with lateral quickness on defense in the NBA, he’s extremely strong, and projects to be a capable defender at the next level. Wayne has also shown a lot of fire as a competitor, and showcased the ability to use his athleticism and size to make plays out of loose ball opportunities. Going hand in hand with his competitiveness, his highlight play ability often changed the game’s momentum and was also something that provided great value for the Jayhawks last season","Wayne’s most glaring weakness is his lack of free throw shooting. While his aggression as a slasher was a huge improvement, his 61% free throw clip left a lot of points on the board. His mechanics are not anything to fret over, but this block at the foul stripe seems to be more of a mental block than anything. Selden is a tremendous athlete with strength, end to end speed, and leaping ability; however, his lateral quickness isn’t quite up to par with the rest of his athletic package. His large wingspan and ability to body up can make up for this, but it may cause him some issues defending at the next level. While he did show great improvement as a junior, he’ll still need to hone is all around game to find playing time in the NBA. His foundation is there, and now that he’s finishing at the hoop and hitting a higher clip of 3 pointers, he’s got NBA value, he’s just going to need to continue to work to get major minutes on an NBA roster.",77,230,21.75

One of the best athletes in college basketball this past season … Very explosive and quick off his feet which allows him to get a lot of putbacks … Very good in transition due to speed and ""freakish"" athletic ability … Led the Mountain West in field goal percentage shooting 73.5% in halfcourt situations and top 5 overall in the nation in FG percentage … Did a good job coming off curls and screens to create higher percentage shots … Very crafty and solid finisher around the rim given his wiry frame … Good offensive rebounder and slasher to the basket … With his athletic ability, size, and length, has the potential foundation to be a solid perimeter defender … Good one-on-one perimeter defender … Can easily contest shots, disrupt passing lanes, and defend multiple positions from the 1, 2 and 3.","At a listed weight of 190 lbs, extremely frail build at this point in his career … Somewhat immature basketball player … Desperately in need of added weight and strength to be able to maximize ability to play at the next level … Can easily get pushed off balance coming off screens which limits his scoring options … Needs to improve his ball-handling ability especially in halfcourt situations … Poor shooting mechanics and limited range … Can improve offensive skills and midrange game … As a perimeter player, needs to improve overall feel for the game especially in pick-and-roll situations and ability to see the floor … Was able to get away with less than fundamentally sound defensive mechanics due to his athletic ability and length … Needs to be a more vocal player to succeed at the next level …",79,190,19.36
Isaiah Miles,-1,"Big, skilled forward with an interesting inside-outside game offensively…Great rebounder for his size, averaging over 8 per game last season…Can attack the basket with his decent ball handling ability and athleticism to elevate and finish at the rim…Stands at 6’8"" with an impressive 6’10.5"" wingspan which allows him to pluck rebounds out of the air and defend on the perimeter…Very good at cutting to the basket and creating space for himself in the post…Good three-point shooter who connected on 39% from behind the arc last season.  Shows real potential as a stretch 4 with face-up abilities…Shows a decent array of post moves for a player who is more naturally a face-up scorer…Plays with an aggressive mentality, and it shows in his rebounding and attacking the basket…Phenomenal foul shooter at 89%, and he draws a fair amount of trips to the line.  Overall just an extremely efficient player, with shooting percentages of 52-39-89…Shot very well in workouts leading up to the draft…","Miles may struggle to defend NBA power forwards in the post as he has more of a small forward body…Sort of a tweener at the forward position.  In some ways, this equals versatility, but in others, his skill set indicates the lack of a true position…Tough to evaluate as the bulk of his games came against Atlantic 10 competition throughout his college career.  Still, he held his own in games against Villanova, Cincinnati, and Florida…Underwhelming athleticism.  Posted near-bottom numbers in most every athletic test at the combine.  This could limit his effectiveness in transition in the faster-paced NBA and he could also struggle to guard bore athletic players…",80,220,22.05
Dorian Finney-Smith,-1,"A defensive minded forward with a blue collar work ethic and high effort level … Has solid athleticism and great length with a 7-foot wingspan … A surprising outside shooter, connecting on 43% of his 3 point shots as a junior and 37% as a senior (2.0 makes per game) … Shows some ability to defend on the perimeter and in the post … Solid decision maker with a positive a/to ratio … Productivity showed a solid increase in each of his four seasons in college … Team oriented player with four years of experience (three in the SEC) … Ability to play as a small ball four could give him some added intrigue … Solid at finishing around the rim and strength gives him the ability to play through contact … Strong offensive rebounder and gives good effort on the boards … Seems to have a solid understanding of what he does well and doesn’t try to do too much or play out of his comfort zone … Big hands give him good control of the ball …","Limited as an offensive player … Not great at creating offense for himself. Too predictable and too much of a straight line player when he tries to ISO and drive … Shot has mechanical problems as he shoots it from his shoulder and sort of slings the ball … An older player as a 23 year old senior so therefore not viewed as a player with a great deal of upside left to develop … Could be viewed as a ""tweener"" player lacking a position as he’s not truly a small forward and too small to play as a full time 4 … Hit a decent 73% from the line as a senior but shot very poorly in both his freshman (58%) and junior seasons (59%) … Lacks much of an ISO game, not a great ball handler … Shot a low FG percentage for a forward (44%), granted a high number of shots came from the perimeter (50% of all FG attempts were from 3) … Difficult to see him as a full time SF as his ball skills aren’t great, and he lacks the lateral speed to stay with quick wing players … Shooting form is not ideal. Although he’s got good efficiency, it may be tough for him to extend his shot further without reworking his form … A good athlete, but not a great one … Has absolutely no post game, which is unfortunate because he could use it at the next level as a SF that posts up smaller wings …",80,215,23.15

Gracin Bakumanya,-1,"He’s a 6-11 big man, but with the projection to become a 7-1, with impressive wingspan, coordination and solid frame. He has shown intriguing potential, thanks to his soft touch and range also behind the three point line, showing a possible evolution as PF on a stable basis … He has solid instincts as a scorer, showing impressive sense of position and timing, he’s often in the right spot in the paint to score easy buckets … His combination of mobility and size makes him an effective P&R player, with the ability to close mainly with the right hand … He’s definitely a good passer for the role, especially from the top of the painted area … Solid rebounder for the role, using his sense of position and long wingspan … In Antibes he has shown commitment and will to improve, spending several hours directly with his coach, as a part of a specific program to be followed.","His lower body is still rather skinny, with limited leaping abilitiy and explosiveness … This affects his effectiveness on the boards, as he struggles to keep his balance and to withstand contact effectively … He lacks awareness of his position and his role on the court, due to the lack of experience in organized basketball … This shortcoming is quite visible especially on the defensive end, where he’s sometimes lost, missing rotations and helps in closeouts … His shot mechanics are still not fluid, he should use his legs more and speed up his release … He’s still raw in a lots of aspects of the game, including post game, where he shows some basics, but lacks confidence in the use of his body to take position and to exploit his pivot foot to take the baseline … Playing at the U20 French level is still not enough as a benchmark and a team selecting him should rely mostly on his potential development.",83,220,18.92
Kyle Wiltjer,-1,"A bigtime shooter. Has in the gym range and absolutely cannot be left open or he will knock down a 3 point shot … Looking at his NBA potential he could be a lethal weapon in pick and pop situations, playing alongside a quick and explosive guard … In a league that is based on spacing and shooting, he could become a valued piece in any offense creating gaps in defense for guards to attack the rim and punishing any kind of help from his man … One of the things that has made him so hard to guard has been his great touch and footwork, something that helped him punish any switch by the defense … Extremely confident and skilled, he understands the game and despite his athletic shortcomings and slow body, there is no doubt he could benefit offenses in the NBA … Competitive, smart and motivated kid …","Defense. Slow feet combined with lack of athleticism … Lacks both strength and length … Physique for a power forward is not good … Likely will always struggle to put on much strength … He will struggle mightily to guard  NBA power forwards in the post and also struggle in pick and roll situations … Could show more toughness on the defensive end and on the glass, as well as protecting the rim … Most of his NBA career will depend on how teams value what he can bring on offense vs. how to limit his lack of effectiveness on defense … Will turn 24 in October …",82,245,23.69
Isaiah Taylor,-1,"One of the fastest point guards in the NCAA, Taylor has immense potential in the transition game and his elite change of direction ability and foot speed make him a real threat to get into the lane … He has a deadly floater, an array of one handers, and is a creative finisher. Isaiah is clearly used to getting off high degree of difficulty shots over taller players … He’s a strong ball handler, and right now looks to be able to carry over these skills in the drive and kick game in the NBA. For a young guy (20 years old) he seems to have a nice foundation in the pick and roll game … Texas ran a 3 guard lineup last season, and Taylor put up a very solid 4 apg in a system in which he wasn’t the only guy setting up the offense … He’s tall for a point guard (6’2"" – 6’3’’ in shoes) and he’s a very pesky defender,  especially in man to man situations … He’s been utilized very successfully in press situations, and does a great job of staying in front of his man. This is definitely aided by his direction changing ability and lateral quickness … If he comes away with a steal, he’s down the court with a layup in a split second. He’s also shown improvement on his shot as a sophomore. A good free throw shooter, His 83% clip through his first 12 games in 2014-15 is a solid number, and he’s also shown growth on his long range game already far surpassed his season total for 3 pointers from last season with 8 … His speed gives him intriguing potential and a pretty high ceiling, but he does have to tighten up some other parts of his game and get stronger …","Although improving, Taylor really lacks a go to jump shot, and it’s very evident as he’s often more comfortable shooting flip shots and one handers 10 feet away from the goal … He hits these shots at a higher rate than one would expect, but it affirms that he isn’t particularly confident in his mid range jumper … He has improved his college three point range, but still lacks the ability to hit the NBA three with any sort of consistency … Isaiah is a thin guy, and only weighs in at 168 lbs. To translate his speed and quickness to the defensive end in the NBA, he’s going to have to bulk up in order to not be constantly giving up a strength advantage … Taylor could probably play at 185-190 pounds while maintaing his quickness. It’d also help him finish at the rim where he shot just 49.2% during the 2013-14 season … Should look to become a more vocal leader …",74,180,21.97
Robert Carter,-1,"Burly power forward with the skills to be a faceup 4…Creative post scorer with soft touch around the rim…Surprisingly adept ballhandler.  Can take the ball to the basket if his defender (usually a power forward) over-commits to defending him on the perimeter…Passable jump shooter.  Connected on a third of his three-pointers last season, making him a solid stretch 4…Has a massive wingspan at 7’3"", which makes up for his below-average power forward height of 6’8""…Good defensive rebounder thanks to his long arms and strong frame…Efficient scorer, converting on 55% of his field goals, including 62% from inside the arc…Has the length and decent enough mobility to step out and guard more athletic 4’s on the perimeter…Very sold shot-blocker thanks to his length and instincts…","Conditioning is certainly something that hinders Carter.  His body fat percentage was one of the highest measured at the combine and he only averaged 27 minutes per game last season despite being a vital contributor…Not particularly great at any one skill.  Can be an effective face-up 4 at the college level, but he may lack the athleticism, shooting ability, and defending prowess to translate his game effectively…Decent handles, but his lack of speed (had the slowest 3/4-court sprint at the combine) limits his effectiveness in transition…Occasionally appears too confident in his shot creating abilities and tries to do too much.  Averaged nearly 4 turnovers per 40 minutes last season…",80,250,22.24
Sheldon McClellan,-1,"Dangerous scoring wing who can score from every level of the defense … An explosive athlete with a near 40 inch vertical leap, McClellan finishes above the rim with consistency … McClellan is a smooth, creative finisher, who can get to the rim with either his explosiveness or his finesse, depending on what the situation requires … McClellan is also a very good outside shooter, connecting on 41% from 3 this season … He’s proficient on the catch-and-shoot, with his feet set, but he’s also a great shooter off the dribble … Great in transition, McClellan is on the finishing end of many an alley-oop.  He’s also a smart cutter along the baseline, creating easy alley-oop opportunities for any decent point guard … On defense, he’s got good lateral quickness to help him stay in front of his man and make up for subpar fundamentals … His lane agility time was second-best of anyone at the combine … He’s a pretty good ball handler who can create his own shot with his strength and handles … Very efficient offensive player who converted on over 50% of his field goal attempts (along with 41% of his 3’s and 84% of his free throws) … Pretty stepback jumper that makes him dangerous from mid-range…","McClellan shot the ball very well on the whole, but he was a very streaky shooter, and when his shot wasn’t falling, he often keep putting it up … He’s occasionally a willing passer, but once he gets into attack mode, he doesn’t look for his teammates and he rarely passes out of the lane … A bit temperamental on the floor.  Gets on teammates verbally when frustrated and has poor shot selection when he starts to miss … A bit thin, McClellan weighs under 200 lbs. and won’t be able to be as physically dominant in the NBA … Not the most fluid athlete … Pretty good dribbler, but he doesn’t always handle the ball very tight to his body, which could lead to more turnovers against NBA length … Has good quickness, but his mediocre wingspan (6’7"") and poor fundamentals and defensive awareness allow him to get lost on defense or sometimes lose his man … Very old for an NBA prospect.  McClellan is 23 and turns 24 in December …",78,200,23.52

Not only does Ibeh have great size for an NBA big man, not to mention he also weighs in at a well-muscled 260 pounds … He is a quick leaper, with good lateral quickness, and solid end to end speed … Even at the NBA level his athleticism is above average …  Prince regularly finished alley oops well above the rim, and has strong hands … The reigning Big 12 Defensive player of the year, Ibeh showed great timing both guarding the rim, and blocking shots coming over from the help side. He blocked 2.4 shots in just 22.3 minutes in Big 12 play (in which he took over starting duties for the injured Cam Ridley). In addition to the shots he connected on, he altered many more, and he actually did a pretty good job of keeping blocks in play … Many times his swats would lead to fast break opportunities on the other end for the Longhorns, and when they were launched out of play, there was a clear shift in momentum. His pure athleticism, size, and defensive ability are his main appeal at the next level … Only a good defensive rebounder, he did a great job of picking up offensive boards for Texas last season. In Big 12 play, he hauled in 2.7 offensive boards per contest which ranked 4th in the conference during league play … Per 40 minutes, Ibeh would have nabbed 4.8 offensive misses. He’s also young for his class. Despite playing 4 years in college, he won’t turn 22 until June 3rd.","A massive project. Prince doesn’t have a great natural feel for the game, and although his physical gifts make him an intriguing defensive option, he’s pretty much just an oop target, and garbage man on offense … Like many athletically gifted big men, he’s a horrid free throw shooter … In 4 seasons for Texas Ibeh shot just .432% on his career and showed little improvement if any during his time in Austin … He’s also not very polished on the block which can be evident when he doesn’t have a clear path to the bucket … He can be prone to missing a bunny over now and then due to a lack of touch … Not a great defensive rebounder for a player with his gifts, can be caught out of position when fighting for defensive boards … Ibeh can be foul prone at times, but will also benefit from the more wide open NBA style …",83,260,22.07
