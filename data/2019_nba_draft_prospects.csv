Natural instincts for where defense is coming from and going to, instinctual dribble counters … Nice outlets, keeps his head up in transition Defensive instincts … Good anticipation on blocks, pins shots w/o goal tending or fouling and allows for team to recover … When he tries, moves feet well on perimeter, quick hands, changes direction well … Plays defensive back well, baiting opposing guards to throw a pass to his guy and then jumping the pass for an easy steal with his great closing speed … Quick hands, gets a lot of strips and deflections … Has shown improvement on pull ups and step back jumpers, looks fluid, getting squared, going straight up but hasn’t made them with great accuracy so far … Magnetic personality, natural entertainer, great kid off the court by all accounts … As long as he continues to develop, intangibles are in place to be a future star … Great conditioning, especially considering his body type …","Playing style and weight puts a lot of pressure on his legs and feet. The question begs to be asked whether he can stay on the floor for a lengthy NBA career … He will likely need to drop another 15-20 lbs in order to sustain his playing style … 250-260 lbs would be ideal. But may not be possible … Shot is somewhat flat with awkward release position, from the side of his head … Is developing into a capable shooter but still needs refinement … Plays with a great deal of emotion, but at times that emotion can get the best of him as he struggles to contain it … Will need to work on not getting too emotional as the 82 game NBA season is a long one and can burn out players that put too much into each and every game … Can get a little out of control at times, needs perimeter game to develop to be less predictable … A good portion of his points come through overpowering less physically developed players, which will not work as well at the next level … Jumper is flat, needs more arch … Struggles to shoot from the perimeter in rhythm … Is much more adept at spotting up when defenders sag off of him than creating shots with defenders on him … Needs to work on polishing a pull up jumper … Poor effort defensively at times and does not always get in a low stance, even though he can sometimes make up for it with his unique athleticism … Loses focus defensively at times, gambles for blocks and steals … Not always in great position, at times late on rotations … Back to the basket game could use some work …",78,280,18.97
Ja Morant,2,"Dynamic athlete and playmaker, adept at creating offense for himself as well as teammates … Has ideal size for the lead guard position with a 6’3 frame and long arms … Possesses high level passing ability, even for a point guard (as evidenced by his NCAA leading 9.3 apg) … Shows great imagination to make creative passes, and seems to lead teammates into easy scores with his anticipation and vision … Plays with an edge and shows excellent competitiveness and moxie … Has a fearless style and is willing to put his body on the line and initiate contact in order to make plays … A high level athlete for a point guard with elite speed and quickness, as well as explosive leaping ability … Has great defensive upside with his long arms and great ability to move laterally … Shows a lot of leadership and determination, developing a great rapport with teammates and natural leadership skills … Very difficult to stay in front of as he puts a lot of pressure on opponents with his quickness off the dribble … Incredibly slick and polished with the ball in his hands. His ball handling might be his most advanced skill right now as he goes behind his back and crosses over like the ball is on a string … His ability to change directions and set up drives gives defenders fits … While still an area of concern, the form on his shot actually shows solid promise … Has shown the ability to hit deep three balls … Has made a habit of rising to the occasion in big games, had 38 pts, 9 reb and 5 ast against Alabama and led a big 2nd half comeback against Auburn finishing with 25 pts, 8 reb and 7 ast … Makes his teammates better … Pushes the ball extremely well up the court … Has a lot of shake and bake, juke moves to set up defenders for the blow by and finishes well around the rim … Shooting efficiency should improve in time … Good shooting motion, very solid release and follow through … Plays with a swagger … A solid defender who gets 1.8 steals per game and doesn’t gamble too often or reach and pick up unnecessary fouls … Does a good job of getting to the line (7 times per game) and capitalizing … Career 80% free throw shooter is indicative of  quality shooting ability and gives him promise as a perimeter shooter … Tremendous rebounder at 7 per game, following up a great freshman season (6.5 per) … Has developed in his game management and ability to run the offense in a half court set, though this is an area he must improve upon … Utilizes the finger roll well to finish off drives … Very shifty. Can stop on a dime and has the ability to stop/start and change speeds at an elite level, making him extremely difficult to contain … Precision passer. Really adept at making accurate lob passes for ally oops from all over the court … Shows a great feel for the game, exhibiting the ability to dribble right through double teams and pressure, as he did in the Racer’s late December match up with the top 10 rated Auburn Tigers … Has a ton of upside left to develop and is very young for a sophomore, having turned 19 just a few months ago, in August …","Developing the ability to consistently knock down the three point shot is one of the few hurdles left in his development … The form on his shot looks decent, but the results haven’t been there yet on a consistent basis … Shot shows nice potential, even from behind the arch, but he needs to put in hours of work shooting both mid range and 3 point shots in order to develop the muscle memory and ability to hit shots in rhythm with consistency (currently shooting 30% from 3 on the year) … Can get overly aggressive with passes at times … Also forces the issue on drives and gets stripped or loses the ball, but for a player with his ability, learning through mistakes is the natural progression … Must cut down on turnovers (4.9 per game) and learn to value the ball a little better … Growing pains. He has such an immense amount of ability and is still figuring out how to utilize his physical gifts at the point guard position … Needs to become more adept at facilitating the pick and roll … Has a tendency to telegraph outside shots at times and get them blocked … Body is very thin and will need to add some strength and muscle over the next few years in order to better finish drives and absorb contact, as well as not get bullied by the more physical guards at the next level … Level of competition may cause some teams to be skeptical … He has proven it against solid competition, performing exceptionably well against Auburn and Alabama as a sophomore, but some may question whether his prolific stats are more of a result of his lack of competition throughout much of his sophomore year …",75,175,19.87
RJ Barrett,3,"Lefty 2-guard who plays the game with a lot of determination and energy … Excellent finishing footwork after gathering dribble with Eurostep and hop step and sidesteps that he uses to weave around defenders … Much stronger than his frame suggests … Aggressive, physical, creates contact and draws fouls … Excellent craftiness as a finisher and finds ways to get defenders off balance … Great body control in the paint, nice runners and finger rolls in close … Good with use of pivots, and utilizes fakes effectively … Has a great first step off the catch and against close outs … Fast in open court, often beats several guys in transition … Able to fluidly change direction going full speed … High basketball IQ, gets to the open spots on the floor, moves well without the ball, runs the lanes in transition, moves into passing angles … Instinctive scorer who finds gaps as a driver with great pacing, hesitations and moves inside. 6’7 with a strong frame and good length … Prototypical wing … Quick twitch … Changes direction on a dime after picking up dribble … Plays hard, loves running the court, timing and positioning as a rebounder … Size and quickness to switch multiple positions defensively … Moves his feet well as on ball defender, good lateral agility … Hard to keep up with him in open court already but strength makes it easy to brush off defenders and finish in traffic … With no pressure on his handle in open court is really fast changing directions … Improved vision a lot over the past year, good recognition and unselfish … Doesn’t get out of control … Decent shooter off the catch when his feet are set …","May have peaked to some degree in high school as he was clearly the top kid in his class as a senior in HS … Outside shot lacks great form and confidence seems to waver … Good athlete, fast in transition and can explode in space but doesn’t necessarily play above the rim or have great explosiveness in half court situations … Needs to improve his ball handling to become a more efficient half court player … Left hand dominant, looks awkward dribbling or finishing with his right … Almost always ends up going back to his left hand … Isn’t aggressive off the ball defensively, doesn’t rotate hard … Could look to take advantage of his physical tools more defensively and create more turnovers … Poor ball control, handle is high and loose, struggles to make passes off the dribble … Poor shooter off the dribble and has a relatively slow and inconsistent release … Needs time to get it off cleanly … Not accurate with his passes, sloppy ball placement … Can get too caught up in playing hero ball and get tunnel vision trying to create and not looking for teammates at the end of games … Fearless approach can end up being overconfidence … Seems to have an alpha personality, but may need to learn to adjust his game some and defer more at the next level … Sort of a jack of all trades, master of none type …",79,210,19.03
DeAndre Hunter,4,"Athletic forward with a versatile skill set … Strong Body … Can play multiple positions on both ends of the floor … Possesses good length with a 7’2"" wingspan … Plays very hard on both ends … His focus, energy and intensity on every play is impressive … He plays under control and really seems to understand his game … Plays to his strengths and rarely forces things or gets out of control … He shows good footwork and agility for his size … Above average athlete overall … Offensively, he is very versatile as he should be able to play both the SF and PF positions, at times, in the NBA … Some scouts have even mentioned the 2G at times, but that is probably a stretch … Excellent mid-range jump shooter … Can create some off the dribble … Plays under control and gets to his spots … Impressive 3pt shooter at 42% this season … shows range to 22’ … Scores well around the basket … good body control … Has a good feel for how to score at all three levels … Decent ball handler and passer for his size …  He has a good feel for the game on this end … Defensively, he can guard multiple positions … He can switch 1-5 as well as anyone his size which fits right into today’s modern NBA game … He plays hard and gives great effort on this end … His length and commitment give him elite upside as a defender … Team oriented player, he puts winning over individual success and stats … Has an excellent approach to the game mentally … Shows leadership skills and the ability to be a good teammate … All his numbers and percentages have improved while taking on a bigger role this year at Virginia … Beacame a mature and disciplined player with three years at Virginia …","There is not one clear thing that he does elite for the next level … He has offensive versatility but what go to move does he have for the NBA? … Has never shown the ability to take over games offensively … He can shoot the NBA 3pt shot but he has limited attempts and he isn’t a shoot first type player … His ideal position is still a question mark … Not sure if his perimeter handle or passing will allow him to be a high-level SF … Also uncertainty about whether his size and physicality will allow him to be a high-level PF … He is considered a “versatile and possibly elite defender” by many scouts but his steal and block rate is very low for that projection … He looks mechanical at times … For his size, length and agility his rebounding numbers are shockingly low …He is an older Sophomore compared to most , turning 22 later this year …",79,225,21.56
Darius Garland,5,"6’3 point guard … Great speed and quickness … Good body control with the ability to make acrobatic layups at different angles. Finishes with either hand at the rim … Can serve as a scorer or distributor, creating offense for himself and others. Led USA in scoring at the adidas Eurocamp with 15.3 points per game.

Uses screens well, splits the defense, and gets where he wants as a dribble penetrator. Changes directions with the ball and plays under control at a high speed. Changes his speed and uses hesitations effectively … Instinctive. Makes correct reads. Plays within the flow of the game, doesn’t force his will.

Jarrett Culver,6,"After playing a supportive role at Texas Tech as a freshman, Jarrett Culver has quickly shot up draft boards as a sophomore by displaying a great all around floor game … At 6’6” Culver displays the size to play both the two and three spots at the next level, and with solid athletic ability and length … Offensively he’s paced the Red Raiders all season with 18.5 points per game (which is 25.3% of TTU’s offensive output) as well as acted as primary distributor and ball handler … Throw in his 3.6 assists per game, and he’s directly involved in over 35% of Texas Tech’s scoring plays … His all around offensive game makes him a multi-dimensional scorer as he has a fundamentally sound high arching shot in which he needs to be respected from beyond the arc, as well as being able to pull up from the mid-range … Culver’s footwork and hesitation moves on the perimeter are terrific as well, and will directly translate to the next level … He’s great at drawing his defenders off balance, and has a great array of moves once he gets in the lane … Jarrett also displays a high basketball IQ, and the ability to make a play when his team needs one the most … Playing in such a defensive oriented system in college, Culver has great defensive instincts, quick hands, and displays good effort … He’s an above average rebounder for a 6’6” guard (6.3 rebounds per game) and off a defensive miss or a steal, he’s a tough matchup in fast break situations due to his good passing ability … He projects as a plus defender in the NBA.","Culver’s weaknesses are mostly things that can be improved with continued growth as a player … Right now his 3 point shot is worth keeping his defender honest at the college level, but he’s going to need to continue to hit the gym to become a high level long range shooter in the NBA … Can also stand to tighten his handle as he makes the leap to the next level … He’ll also need to continue to work on his body … Culver’s 195 pound frame will get pushed around by larger NBA two guards and small forwards, though he does have solid legs as a base … He doesn’t have the elite run/jump ability to make up for this at this point either … At 6’6” his height is good for a swingman being considered at the top of the draft, but not elite … He just needs to continue to develop at the same pace he’s done from his freshman to sophomore years … Jarrett has a very NBA translatable offensive game, and a lot of his weaknesses can be improved upon in the gym.",78,195,20.34
Coby White,7,"Lighting quick 6’5’’, 185-pound combo guard … Aggressive scoring mentality but also unselfish passer of the ball… Shifty player with an excellent first step that allows him to blow by defenders … Versatile scorer. Can score anywhere on the floor, either getting his own shot off the dribble or catch and shoot situations …  Has a quick and accurate release … Adjusts his body midair on challenging layups … Great job at creating space for his shot … Can score from all three levels … Gets defenders off balance because of his quick stop/start ability … can get his shot off against top perimeter defenders … Has offensive versatility because of his ability to play on or off the ball … A lot of upside left to develop, having just finished his freshman year … Solid three-point shooter (35.3% in his freshman season at North Carolina) and his range that extends out to the NBA 3-pt line … solid mid-range game with a nice pull-up jumper and floater … Is a scoring threat from anywhere in the half court … Has the ability to score in bunches and go off on any given night … Scored 33 or more points in three games with the Tar Heels … Impressive lateral quickness … Good ball handler and facilitator, averaging 4.1 assists per game … Creates offense for himself and scores at the rim with his right or left hand … Drives aggressively to the hoop, drawing contact …Can finish at or above the rim with either hand and regularly finishes difficult layups … Great at penetrating and drawing fouls to get to the foul line … Shot 3.7 free throws per game … Confident shooter … Brings a competitive energy on the defensive end … Does a great job at finding his teammates in transition …Stays in front of opponents well and plays with active hands… Averaged 16.1 points and 1.1 steals per game at North Carolina … Excellent free throw shooter (80%) … Moves well without the basketball …",His quickness can be both a blessing and a curse … More effective as a scorer than a playmaker … Needs to improve as a decision maker and passer … Good athlete but does not have a physical frame that stands out … Can improve overall as a playmaker … Can get out of control… Must cut down on turnovers with 2.7 per game in his freshman season … Good athlete but not an incredibly explosive leaper … His low release point makes it challenging to get his shot off over tall defenders … Not a great rebounder … Sometimes passes up open teammates for a forced shot of his own … Can improve field goal percentage from 42 percent for his freshman year at UNC … Tends to throw inaccurate passes when he is moving at a faster rate than the play is developing at … Overall strength can improve … Finishing athletically at the rim will be tougher at the next level …,77,190,19.35
Jaxson Hayes,8,"Blessed with tremendous size and length, Jaxson Hayes’ physical tools are probably some of the most obvious traits that jump off the page when projecting him for the next level … Standing 6’11” and sporting a 7’4” wingspan with massive hands and a frame that should easily be able to build from his current 220 pound weight … Hayes also pairs this with fluid athleticism and end to end speed … At Texas this length and athleticism allowed him to protect the rim at an elite level … While only playing 23.3 minutes per contest, Jaxson blocked 2.2 shots per game (3.77 per 40 minutes) and altered a significant amount of potential shots, something that doesn’t show up in the stat column … These physical traits should translate to the next level and make him a legit NBA rim protector … Hayes’ mobility also allows him to hedge well during pick and roll defense, and not be limited to a lane clogger on the defensive end …  His defense is probably his calling card at this point in his development, but Hayes has offensive appeal as a rim runner/lob target as well as a player with a track record of finishing around the rim … According to hoop-math.com, Hayes shot 86.7% on his shots around at the rim and 72.7% of his shots overall … His massive hands also make him a high level lob target who can grab just about everything in his vicinity … He’s also a pretty solid offensive rebounder (1.8 orpg) and can be respectable collecting misses … He certainly plays within his limits on offense, but a surprising 74% FT percentage and solid mechanics on his shot gives him some upside in the face up game … Jaxson is also the son of an NFL tight end, and knows what kind of dedication it takes to be a professional athlete, which also bodes well for his development as a player …","While Hayes possesses a great frame, he’ll need to continue to not only add muscle to ready himself for the next level, but also work on his toughness … While flying though the air, and catching lobs using his finesse, he’s quite comfortable, but more physical players got under his skin and he often faded in effectiveness when being bodied up on both offense and defense … Gaining that edge may mean the difference of him being a serviceable NBA defender to one who excels … Like many young big men, Hayes is also foul prone … The game is still a little fast for him, and hopefully as he develops he’ll be able to cut back on ticky tack fouls … He’s not a particularly good passer either, and only tallied 9 assists all season for the Longhorns … Because he’s likely far away both skill and body wise from being a NBA contributor, a team is taking the risk that he doesn’t produce much offensively before his first contract is up …",83,220,19.09
Rui Hachimura,9,"Athletic forward and smart decision maker with a versatile skill set … Reliable, steady performer with a smooth playing style … Very team oriented player, who puts his team’s performance and winning over individual accolades … Excellent mid-range jump shooter, and continues to add range and consistency … Possesses great length with a 7’2 wingspan … An above average athlete with agility, good speed and solid leaping ability … Very good at running the floor and finishing on the break … A strong competitor. Plays the game with consistent focus and energy … Coming to the US three years ago and having never played AAU ball, he has always played a structured game … Being late to the game, he never really developed any bad habits … Has an excellent approach to the game and shows the desire to improve through hard work … Has developed his ball handling to the point where he can comfortably bring the ball up the floor, lead the break as well as take bigger opponents off the dribble from the perimeter … Shows good touch around the rim … Plays a very controlled game. Doesn’t gamble for steals or generally get out of control on drives … Really embraced the role of team leader and superstar in his junior year, ramping up his scoring output from 11.6 ppg to 19.6 ppg … Should be a solid scorer at the next level due to his ability to knock down open jumpshots consistently … Solid defender. Does a good job of contesting shots on the perimeter, utilizing his length and anticipation … Good feel for playing in the post. Uses leverage and positioning to his advantage  … Understands how to use his body to create space and shield defenders off in order to get shots off … Strong, athletic body with good muscle tone … Scores well around the rim … Shows solid use of his left hand, both ball handling and finishing with dunks and shots around the rim … Has textbook shooting mechanics, squares up, quick release with follow through … A (decent) 74% free throw shooter and and should be able to improve that over time to be an 80+% FT shooter at the next level … Shows solid leadership skills … Confident personality. Rises to the challenge as he did against Duke in Maui, in their early season match up, leading Gonzaga to the win over Zion Williamson and Duke to capture the Maui Jim’s Maui Invitational championship … Has put in a lot of work in the weight room and has a very solid frame with good core and leg strength … Great conditioning. Gonzaga often uses him to spearhead their press and he never appears winded or runs out of energy late in games … Naturally athletic frame with good muscle tone …","Needs to continue to improve his 1-on-1 skills and ability to create off the dribble, in order to enhance his shooting and scoring ability … Must continue to polish his feel for the game … Has a good wingspan, but at 6-8 is a bit small at the power forward position … Not a perfect fit at either forward position, though he could work at the next level as a match up, small ball four if he continues to get stronger and expands his shooting range … Doesn’t possess the fastest first step to get by smaller defenders … Must become a better passer and ball handler and add the ability to create pull up jumpers in rhythm … Being late to the game, (playing against high level competition) there are times that he looks a little lost when plays break down. He has moments where he makes shots that look unorthodox or shots that are off by a lot. His lack of feel at times is due to coming to the game late … At times will challenge bigger players and go into the teeth of the defense and force up contested low percentage shots, or get his shot blocked  … Only 7% of his shots were from three point range, though he did hit a very solid clip at 45% … Should look to expand his shooting range (to NBA 3) and make the three point shot a bigger part of his arsenal … Not the most physical of players at the 4 position. Could improve on his rebounding at 6.5 rebound per game … Struggles at times to keep a handle on the ball, allowing it to get poked loose. Should look to strengthen his hands and wrists with weights … Struggles some to limit opponents scoring. At times gets beat off the dribble by small er quicker players …",80,235,21.38

Dylan Windler,26,"Mid-Major lefty swingman, Dylan Windler, has drawn some serious buzz after putting up a monster senior season, and displaying the type of long range shooting NBA teams covet … Windler’s superb stroke was displayed in many different ways … Dylan nailed 100 threes as a senior at 42.9% shooting on 7.1 attempts per contest … This type of production isn’t a new development in his game as he hit 42.9% his junior season, and 40% as a soph. He’s great at coming off screens and floating the corners to get open shots … Windler needs very little time to catch and setup for his shot, and his left handed release can sometimes catch defenders off guard … Playing in a fast paced Belmont offense many of his 3’s this season came in transition which will aid in his translation to the NBA landscape … Additionally, at 6’7.5” in shoes and sporting an 8’8.5” standing reach, he’s plenty tall  to get his shot off in the league … Windler is also an aggressive player, who not only hunts for his shot, but hustles for rebounds, and takes advantages of cutting opportunities to get shots at the rim … His 10.8 rebounds per game is a very good level for a player who spends so much time around the perimeter, and his 1.9 offensive rebounds per contest lead to 23 second chance buckets … Another plus regarding his rebounding is that he’s really good at pushing the pace after collecting a miss on the defensive end … As rebounding is one of the most translatable skills to the NBA, while Windler is not elite in terms of positional size and athletic ability, he measures out pretty well and project to at least be solid on the glass … With a 6’10” wingspan, a 2.94 second shuttle and a 37.5” max vertical, Dylan tested really well when compared to his peers … He’s not really a slasher, but  works off cuts well, and often finishes above the rim … He shot a very good 74.5% at the rim last season(hoop-math.com) and converts free throws at an 84.7% clip … A low mistake player, who only averaged 2.1 TO’s per game despite being a focal point in Belmont’s offense … Very methodical, Dylan uses spacing well, and will likely benefit from the deeper NBA three point line …","Despite being surprisingly quick and athletic, Dylan really needs to work on his strength to make the leap to the next level … At 195 pounds, he’ll likely be effected by stronger players at his position, and will struggle to match up defensively … He wasn’t much of a shot blocker in college, and will likely not be a factor in contesting shots … Windler will also turn 23 before his first NBA game, so he has a mature game while being pretty close to his prime … His ceiling doesn’t project to be that much higher than where he is now …  One on one perimeter scoring will be more difficult in the NBA, and he will likely have to rely more on running off screens, while a good ball handler, he’s not exactly a break you down or blow past you type of presence on the wing …",79,195,22.76
