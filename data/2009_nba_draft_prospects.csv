Blake Griffin,1,"Freak of nature, off the charts athletic specimen type … The perfect storm of strength, athleticism and work ethic. It’s rare to find elite level talent that also possesses the character and drive to outwork everyone … Griffin has immense potential due to his superior athletic ability and his willingness to put the work in to improve … A special talent and a special kid … Never takes a play off. Knows only one speed and gives his all on every possession… A dominant rebounder who will be one of the top rebounders in the league for years to come … An incredibly strong and athletic body. His strength at his age is incredible and he will surely get stronger as his body continues to fill out (between the ages of 20-24) … Plays the game with amazing toughness, he’s a wrecking ball who loves contact in the paint … Runs the floor well. Excellent speed and agility in the open floor … His explosiveness puts him in rare company … Has the ability to face the basket and use the dribble to get to the rim … Very comfortable handling the ball for a post player who can dribble the ball up the floor, in order to break the press and get through traffic … An excellent passer who has good vision and spots double teams quickly finding the unguarded teammate for openshots … Has great hands (big and soft) allowing him to palm the ball with ease and control the ball on dunks and rebounds … His post skills are showing nice development with an effective drop step as well as a jump hook … His mid-range shot has shown excellent improvement between his freshman and sophomore seasons … He has begun to perfect the Tim Duncan mid-range shot high off the glass … Defensively he gives a high effort level and does a solid job of staying out of foul trouble (fouled out of 1 game as a sophomore) … Has good length and size at 6-9 ½ to 6-10 with a good wingspan … He’s the type of dynamic athlete and talent that if he happened to only be 6-7 to 6-8 (with shoes on) as some people erroneously think, he could actually develop into a top level small forward at the NBA level … High character guy. Humble. Not interested in the superstar limelight or partying, he is extremely focused …","Still not a great shooter. Must become more comfortable shooting the ball by putting time in with practice/repetition … He’s improved to the point where his shot is good, but he still needs to put a lot of work in to become a great shooter and scorer (don’t bet against him – Karl Malone came into the league as a 50% ft shooter and ended up a 75-80% shooter) … Needs to improve from the free throw line (59%) … Due to the fact that he plays such a physical game, he goes to the line a lot, so improving his FT % to 75% will be a huge boost … Must continue to develop his offensive repertoire in the post. He has great strength and using that to his advantage in sealing his opponents will make him even more effective … His willingness to sacrifice his body (as witnessed when he flew over the scorers table the first game back after missing a week due to concussion) could lead to injuries if he doesn’t use good judgment (there are times to put it all on the line and times to hold back to some degree with an 82 game season) … Still needs work on the defensive end. With his tremendous explosiveness, he should be a better shot blocker (1.2 bpg). He just needs to learn better timing and anticipation … Should look to become a more vocal leader …",82,248,20.29
Hasheem Thabeet,2,"Jim Calhoun called Thabeet “one of the most dominant players in the history of college basketball,” and it’s hard to disagree … Had Thabeet returned for his senior year, he likely would have broken the NCAA career-record for blocked shots (he left UConn 118 behind the all-time leader, Wojciech Mydra of Louisiana-Monroe)… Averaged 4.5 blocks per game as a junior, but altered about eight or nine more … Has impeccable timing and athleticism for someone 7-foot-3 … Is extremely mobile for someone his size. Often beats guards down the court … Jumpshot improved considerably in his three years at UConn. Towards the end of his junior year, Thabeet began to take—and make—12-15 foot jumpshots within the offense … Has a soft touch and a good stroke. With some polishing, there’s reason to believe Thabeet can be a consistent mid-range shooter at the next level … Shot just 63 percent from the free throw line, but shoots it with confidence and an excellent motion for a bigman and should be able to increase that number to the mid-to-high 70s throughout his career … Has a good nose for the ball on the boards … Tremendous lateral quickness for a player his size. Can guard smaller players out to the 3-point line … Is a bit stronger than he appears. Overall, Thabeet has a scary combination of size and athleticism that doesn’t come along often … Upside is tremendous.","Post game needs refining. Thabeet has not learned to keep the ball high. He puts the ball on the floor way too often instead of going straight up without dribbling. This leads to turnovers and more difficult shots … Though he uses both hands fairly well, Thabeet lacks back-to-the-basket moves and his hands are suspect. Offensively, he relies mostly on alley-oops and offensive rebounds to collect his points … Needs to develop a go-to post-move, whether it be a strong drop-step or jump-hook … Has good body strength, but toughness seems to be a questionmark. Gets pushed around by stronger players and spends more time on the ground than almost any player in college basketball … Looked absolutely helpless against Pittsburgh’s DeJuan Blair, one of the few players he faced with an NBA-type body … Could beef up about 10 pounds more, but needs to maintain his lateral quickness and athleticism … Needs to work on defending the pick and roll. Gets tangled and confused to easily … Still raw offensively, sometimes struggles to catch the ball … Needs to be able to pass the ball out of the double-team a little better.",86,267,22.37
James Harden,3,"Very smooth and crafty wing player … Used his sophomore season to add new dimensions to his game, and he proved to be a steady and consistent scoring threat … One of the most mature and NBA ready players of his class … He has great feel and understanding of the game, knows when he has to be a facilitator and when he has to take over the scoring load … As much as he brings in terms of scoring, his vision and playmaking ability may be his most impressive attributes … He makes great reads and is extremely unselfish … Has a developed body that is prepared to handle the rigors he will face in the league … In ISO situations he has a variety of deceptive and shifty moves that allow him to get by defenders … Out of the triple threat he is difficult to defend because his jab step is long and he sells his shot fake extremely well … Off the bounce he incorporates a nice crossover as well as in&out and behind the back dribbles to get into the lane … His jumper has shown great improvements, he has added range as well as consistency from the outside … His strength is a great asset because he is not afraid to use his body, either on drives or when playing with his back to the basket … Has good balance and body control when finishing around the basket … He has become a difficult matchup, because he looks to take advantage of mismatches, and enjoys playing with his back to the basket … Has a great feel for the ball, on the glass and in the passing lanes …","Ended the season with two very poor performances in the NCAA Tournament, which has unfairly taken some luster off of a great season (he faced zone defenses on both occasions and it forced him to play out of his comfort zone)… Does not posses the great size that many have at his position … His leaping ability and quickness are only marginal, which forces him into tough and contested drives and makes it hard for him to get by people … Even though he has worked on his drives going right, he is still not nearly as comfortable and effective as he needs to be … Defenders have a much easier time cutting of his driving lanes when he does go right … His midrange game will need to become more polished, his ability to make shots off the dribble before the helpside D rotates will be key … He has become turnover prone at 3.4 per game, but this is mostly a result of being asked to do too much …",77,222,19.84
Tyreke Evans,4,"An extremely smooth and talented guard … He has an incredible wingspan, with a very strong and mature body … Has proven that he is able to play as a lead guard, but his natural position seems to be as an SG (where he can still be a facilitator, but can look to score more often) … Loves playing at a fast pace, where he doesn’t have to worry about play calls but can rather create on the fly … Puts constant pressure on the opposing team with his aggressive style … Plays with an edge and cockiness that will help him succeed … Was thrown into the thick of things from the beginning and he responded with a very nice freshman campaign … Playing in a spread offense that is predicated on ISO plays, he has proven that he can break down people off the dribble and get into the lane … His vision and passing are extremely advanced, and he’s shown that he can be a reliable distributor … Possesses deceptive quickness and has a variety of crafty moves with clever footwork that allow him to get by defenders … Has a nice repertoire of counter moves, whether it’s a crossover, spin, in& out or behind the back dribble … In traffic, whether in the half court or in transition, he is very steady and comfortable with his dribble … Even though he rarely finishes above the rim, he has a great touch around the basket, and uses his body and finesse to convert on a good percentage … Defensively, he has great hands and his wingspan allows him to get deflections at a high rate …","His jumpshot has shown very little progress and he continues to struggle with inconsistent shooting … Most of his shooting woes can be directly pointed at his unorthodox release … He slings the ball from behind his head, losing sight of it completely at the point of release … Must improve his midrange game, his pullup lacks rhythm, often leaving him off balance with varying results … A bit of a tweener at this point, does not have the blazing speed or quickness to play as a PG full time, and lacks the vertical explosiveness possessed by the wing players … A decent athlete with an unreliable outside shot (a combination that is not ideal for the next level), he will have to rely on his deceptiveness and crafty game off the dribble to get by defenders … Has always had the ball in his hands and been allowed to operate freely, will he be able to adapt and still be effective playing off the ball and does he know how to use screens or how to work in a traditional half court set? … Is still prone to tunnel vision, where he seems to forget about his teammates … Defensively, he is a bit lackadaisical, and while he does have long arms, because of questionable lateral quickness he will have to work extremely hard to contain the ball on the perimeter … The 3.6 TOs per game are a result of both the system he was in, and his out of control play … Needs to learn to pick his spots better, rather than attacking into traffic and getting into trouble …",77,221,19.78
Ricky Rubio,5,"One of the purest point guards to come around in a while … His vision and ability to deliver precise passes make him the ultimate distributor … Has good size for the position, allowing him to survey the court over top of defenses … A great and natural feel for the game allows him to see plays before they materialize, keeping him one step ahead of the opposition … He is extremely good at maintaining his composure when operating in the pick and roll, he does not panic when the defense converges, but rather shows patience and waits to make his reads … Loves to split the hedge on a high ball screen to get into the paint … Has a wide repertoire of moves off the dribble … Knows how to incorporate head, pass and shot fakes to get defenders off balance and to keep them guessing … Uses change of speed and direction extremely well, always mixing up the moves and staying unpredictable … His shot has come a long way in the last year or so, even to the point where he has become a serious threat from the outside … Defesively, he plays with a lot of energy and puts in a great effort to put pressure on the opposing ball handlers … Quick hands and terrific anticipation allow him to get his hands on a lot of balls … His game is mature beyond his years due to the fact that he has played on the top senior level for a long time … He has been on the draft radar for some years and has been able to maintain a fairly high level of play … Has shown that he can perform on a big stage by being a key member of the Spanish National team in the Olympics …","Has good speed but lacks the great explosiveness that top tier point guards in the league possses … He is forced to shoot high amount of attempts in the paint because his marginal leaping ability makes it difficult for him to finish around the basket … Heavily depends on the pick and roll to create his opportunities and does not show a great ability to break down defenders in ISO situations … Has gotten better at taking what’s open, but his pass first mentality still gets him into trouble as he passes up open shots … His jumper is still not a finished product by any means … Because it takes him a bit to get his feet set, and his release point is fairly low he still looks like a set shooter … Has battled some injuries over the last year, which raises the question of durability and whether he will be able to handle the rigors of an 82 game season … His game has been up and down this season after coming back from his injury (Had a better overall season last year) … His performance on the international scene does not guarantee his game will translate well to the NBA … Is also a bit of a risk because of his high buyout and because he has hinted at staying overseas if he doesn’t go to the right team …",76,180,18.69
Jonny Flynn,6,"Tremendous athlete who always seems to have the game under control … A real competitor who wants to take the big shots and excels in the clutch. His performance in the 6 OT UConn game (16-16 FT) was a good example … One of the quickest guards in college basketball. Exceptional at getting into the lane and fearless finishing (sometimes dunking) over power forwards and centers … Though he doesn’t look overly muscular, Flynn possesses – and utilizes – great body strength for a 180-pound guard … Can use both hands to finish at the rim. Exhibits great body control and creativity to get his shot off against taller defenders … Can get to the foul line as well as any point guard out there, creating contact at the rim … Is a clutch performer who has knocked countless late-game free throws in his two-year career at Syracuse … Makes the game look easy because of his elite speed and quickness … Lockdown defender on the perimeter. Flynn enjoys playing defense and seems to take pride in shutting down opposing point guards … Displays solid court vision and strong leadership abilities … Has the basketball IQ, focus and skills to excel as a pick-and-roll point guard at the next level. Small but long. Has a 6’4 wingspan at just 5’11 barefoot.","Despite elite athleticism and quickness and good strength, Flynn is still just 6-feet tall. He will have a much tougher time attacking the rim against NBA big men than he did in college … Because of that, Flynn needs to develop a more consistent jumpshot … His lack of size is a concern as it takes a special talent to overcome the size issue … More of a scorer than a distributor. Detractors question his ability to play the point guard position and run a team. Is he a natural point guard? Is he really ready? On the positive side, he’s a heady player who will likely learn as he goes and improve … At this point in his career, he is capable of ocasionally knocking down a long-range shot, but still does most of his damage in the paint … Adding a strong 3-point shot and even a consistent 12-15 foot shot to his game would make Flynn virtually unguardable … Can overdribble at times, but Syracuse’s offense called for him to dominate the ball … Will need to adapt to not having the ball in his hands all the time when he gets to the NBA … Will also have to limit turnovers … Flynn averaged 3.4 TOs per game as a sophomore …",72,196,20.39
Stephen Curry,7,"Made transition from SG to PG this year, but he is more of a combo guard that makes good decisions than a true PG … Best scorer in the NCAA so far at 31.9 PPG … Puts a lot of pressure on defense with his scoring ability and quickness … Looks fearless on the floor and plays under control … Can get any shot he wants and has great shot efficiency … Teams are completely focusing on him defensively, rotating different players at him, so he’s under pressure at all times and still finds a way to hit difficult shots every game … Very confident shooter, especially when the game is on the line (vs. WV struggled the whole game and was not afraid to take over at the end) … Curry can put the ball on the floor and create his own shot from anywhere on the floor and he doesn’t need much space to get his shot off (he will cross-over, trough the legs dribble, behind the back…) … Gets defenders off balance using pump fakes and uses defenders overeagerness to his advantage … Very difficult to guard because he possesses a quick and consistent release on his shot (on the move or under pressure as well) and has NBA range … Moves well without the ball. Great footwork when coming off screens, always ready to shoot … Curry is good at changing speed and direction and handles the ball well … In the open court he can stop on a dime at full speed, with his feet in perfect position (under control) and separate from his defender for open jump-shot … Great vision while driving to the basket and control with the ball … Defensively Curry is crafty and a smart defender with good hands 2.9 STL (not a lockout defender); moves his feet well on defense and stays in front of his defender without gambling much … Solid lateral quickness. Possesses a great will to win. Excellent free-throw shooter .874 … Doesn’t show too much emotion, even keeled. Has been around the game his entire life which gives him an edge knowing what it takes …","Far below NBA standard in regard to explosivenes and athleticism … At 6-2, he’s extremely small for the NBA shooting guard position, and it will likely keep him from being much of a defender at the next level … Although he’s playing point guard this year, he’s not a natural point guard that an NBA team can rely on to run a team … Struggles defensively getting around screens … Can overshoot and rush into shots from time to time (vs. WV) … Hasn’t had to deal with getting benched due to poor performance (shooting) which has allowed him to shoot through any slumps. Will have to adjust to not being a volume shooter which could have an effect on his effectiveness … Doesn’t like when defenses are too physical with him … Not a great finisher around the basket due to his size and physical attributes … Makes some silly mistakes at the PG position. Needs to add some muscles to his upper body, but appears as though he’ll always be skinny …",75,181,21.3
Jordan Hill,8,"One of the most improved players this year … Has the ideal size and length for a PF … He has worked on his body, adding some bulk and definition to an already wiry frame; this new strength allows him to get great position on the block where he is able to utilize a number of moves, but he prefers the left shoulder hook shot … He is comfortable operating from the high post, either shooting a nice looking midrange shot, or utilizing his quickness and putting the ball on the floor to get to the hoop … His faceup game developed nicely; not only has he become a consistent threat out to about 17 feet, but he has added some nice sweep and jab moves to go along with it … Even with the added muscle, he has maintained good mobility and quickness … This season he is playing big minutes but he continues to battle and run the floor, showing a very good motor … He has become a rebounding force on both ends of the floor, he attacks the O glass relentlessly and is able to use his body to control the paint on the defensive end … He has cut down his fouls and increased blocks to 3 per game, proving not only that he is a defensive presence but also that he has become more disciplined … With his developing frame and ability to knock down midrange shots, he has the potential to become a very good weapon in screen & roll situations …","He has definitely come a long way, but his inexperience still shows at times … When operating in traffic or while facing double teams, he struggles, putting his head down and turning the ball over frequently … A part of the problem could be his hands, often times he doesn’t catch the ball clean, which allows the defense to converge on him and get him out of his comfort zone … His athleticism and strength also get him into trouble at times as he tries to bully through the defense rather than take what they give him … On the block he favors his right hand on finishes (even when turning to his right shoulder), usually exposing the ball back to the defender, and making his shots much more difficult than they have to be … While he has made strides with his maturity, there are still periods of lackadaisical play that he goes through … His lack of focus is also seen at the line, where he shoots a poor 60% on the season (he has shown he can be reliable, going 9-12 and 9-10 in separate outings this season) …",82,232,21.93
DeMar DeRozan,9,"Jaw dropping athletic specimen. At a chiseled 6’6 220 with large wingspan. Possesses the prototypical frame for an NBA wing …Incredible leaper and explosive finisher. Vertical is reportedly 40 inches plus … His head is even with the rim on many of his dunks … Has all but mastered the art of the mid-range game … Shoots the ball exceptionally well from inside 20 feet. At his best with one dribble and then elevating, preferably to his left … Moves well without the ball, always looking for creases in the defense … Uses screens well and comes off ready to fire … Puts his unique package of leaping ability and strength to good use on the glass … Excellent offensive rebounder (2.4 per game) … Finishes strong around the basket, but shows finesse and variety with floaters and spin moves … Right hand dominant when attacking the hoop. Defenders know this, but he still gets to the rack, a testament to his first step and strength … Puts in a strong effort on the defensive end … Above average lateral quickness, but often too high in his defensive stance. Reads habit passes well off the ball … Showed signs of being a pressure performer, taking his game to another level in the Pac 10 tournament, completely outclassing his competition with a myriad of out of this world athletic displays …","Still very much a work in progress, filled with untapped potential … Despite all of his physical attributes, is often satisfied to ‘go with the flow’. Does not look to dominate … His on court presence leaves much to be desired at this stage of his development .. He plays hard, but rarely full throttle … Passion to be a superstar has always been questioned .. Needs to enhance range on his jumper … Shot only 17% from three in his one season at USC, attempting only 1 per game … He steps into his mid-range jumper well, but tends to fade away on three point attempts … Despite a picturesque stroke, shot only 65% from the FT line … His ball handling needs a lot of work … Rarely, if ever, takes more than one dribble to his left without pulling up or spinning back right … Very predictable. Lacks creativity in the face up game which he will need to succeed at the next level … Despite his size and strength, he did not utilize the post up game at all in college. Not much of a passer or facilitator (1.5 assists per game) … Has a quick first step, but not dynamic … His ceiling is unlimited, but needs to add many significant dimensions to his game. A year older than his freshman counterparts, turning 20 in August.",79,211,19.9
Brandon Jennings,10,"An extremely quick and explosive player … Plays with cockiness and confidence that is necessary to succeed at the top level … His wingspan and leaping ability put him in a rare category of point guards … Has great open court speed and likes to attack in transition … He is very good at changing direction mid-stride without losing speed or control of the ball … He is extremely dangerous off the dribble, where his first step and nice handles allow him to explode by defenders … Gets to the rim and finishes well with a nice mix of moves … Converts a good percentage at the line … His lefty jumpshot looks smooth and he has a quick release … Has the ability to stop on a dime and pull up … Defensively, he has very quick hands and great lateral footspeed allowing him to stay in front of even the quickest guards… Enjoys pressuring ball handlers … Anticipates well and gets out into the passing lanes … Showed mental toughness and he deserves some credit for sticking through a difficult situation, where he encountered a new culture, a coaching change and inconsistent playing time … Was tamed by the system that did not allow all of his strengths to be on display …","Did not have the season needed to improve his stock, but playing the PG position at the top Euro level is difficult for any player, much less one coming straight out of high-school … Has struggled playing in the half court because his jumpshot has been inconsistent, which allows defenders to play off him and clog the lanes … Does not take care of the ball, but is rather very careless with it, trying to make the flashy play rather than the simple and correct one … Needs to learn to control the tempo, to slow down and change gears; he goes at one speed (full throttle) at all times which leads to a high turnover rate and it makes him very predictable and easy to defend … Shows a strong preference to finishing with his left hand, even when going right, he will usually switch back to his strong hand and expose the ball to the defense … Because his frame is extremely light and frail, he has a hard time going up against stronger guards because they can body him out of driving lanes … Defensively, even though he does a good job staying in front of people, they are still able to get their shoulder on him and take him to the basket … Tends to fade on his shot too much, leaving many of them short, especially when playing longer stretches of minutes …",73,170,19.77
Terrence Williams,11,"Freakish athlete with a good build and a great feel for the game … Really showed that he has matured from his freshman year, by leading Louisville to the overall number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and an Elite Eight appearance … He is a triple-double waiting to happen, averaged over 12 points per game, 8 rebounds per game, and over 5 assists per game … He also led the team in steals with over 2 per game … He is a defensive stopper who is able to guard multiple positions on the floor which should help him at the next level … His vision and ability to pass are standout for a wing player … Showed throughout the season that he has good ball handling skills and court sense … Will be a 2-3 at the next level … Has a great knack for knowing where the ball is, giving him an edge on the boards … Put in the right situation, with the right expectations, he can really excel at the next level …","Although he has improved his 3-point shooting over his collegiate career from 31% to 38% his senior year, he will really need to continue his development at the NBA level. His offensive game remains his biggest weakness as he struggles to put points on the board consistently … If his shot isn’t dropping and an athletic defender is keeping him from getting to the rim, his offensive game goes into the tank … Also needs to improve his ability to drive in the lane with his off-hand as well as continuing to develop his ball-handling … These will be particularly important if he wants to play the 2 at the next level … Sometimes likes to go for the ""highlight"" reel play instead of just making the easy play, and seems too relaxed when he’s out on the court … Can fade in and out of games. Needs to develop a killer instinct at all times …",78,213,22.01
Gerald Henderson,12,"One of the more athletic and explosive wing players in this draft class … Has come into his own during his JR season and has become a reliable scoring option as he has expanded his offensive repertoire … His shooting has improved drastically … He is not only comfortable with the spot up from beyond the arc, but he can now reliably put the ball on the deck and get into the paint and elevate for a nice pull up … Makes difficult and contested shots with regularity … Uses a nice up and under move from the perimeter to draw contact … Off the dribble his game has changed as well, where earlier he was strictly a one move player, he is now able to incorporate a counter move to get by the defender when he gets cut off … Combining his strength with his nice first step, he can comfortably get by defenders … His leaping ability allows him to convert on a variety of difficult and acrobatic shots, both from midrange and around the hoop … On finishes, not only is he able to get above the rim, but his terrific body control allows him to take contact and still give the ball a chance to go in … Is not afraid to take the contact going to the basket … Has become a good finesse finisher as well, playing the angles and using the backboard … Put up some very impressive stats while playing less than 30 minutes per game on the season … Knows when he needs to take over, he is not scared to put his head down and attack the basket … Has improved his free-throw shooting in each season, brining it to a respectable 76% … As a defender he is also valuable, because he plays good man-to-man but he also understands the team defense principles, playing the lanes and helping weakside … He is not afraid to take the gamble at times and overplay the pass, or cheat off his defender to block a shot …","At 6-4 he is undersized for an SG, and at this point his game is still more in the mold of an SF, which would make him extremely undersized … While his shooting has shown great improvements, he is not a pure shooter and as a result he goes through periods of inconsistency … Part of the problem is his shot being flat, which results in a lot of front rim misses and becomes even worse when fatigue sets in … His game is not overly smooth, at times he looks mechanical and as if he’s thinking through his move, rather than just playing naturally … Gets carried away at times, trying to make the difficult play rather that take what’s there … He averaged 2.2 turnovers per game, and for his career, he has more TOs than assists … Has games where his shot is not falling and it completely throws him off offensively, he is a rhythm type player and if it’s not his day he has a hard time playing out of it … Even though his shot has improved and he has more confidence from long range, he still shot a fairly poor percentage (34%).",77,215,21.56

Paul Harris,-1,"An absolute physical specimen. Has the body of an NFL linebacker and the athleticism of an Olympic high-jumperUses his body very well as he posts up smaller guards.

Averaged 7.1 rebounds in 21.7 minutes of action during his freshman yearTerrific defender on the perimeter who doesnt take his physical tools for granted as he exhibits a non-stop motor and almost always out-hustles his opponent. Can also defend on the low block because of his superior strengthIs a runaway train on the fastbreak. Has size, speed, athleticism, and ballhandling skills that make him nearly impossible to stop in transitionCan handle in the halfcourt as well and run the point when necessary.","Has one glaring hole in his game- his perimeter shooting. Harris has good form on his shot and is capable of hitting the midrange jumpshot, but appears very tentative when he gets the ball on the perimeter Shot just 1 for 20 (5%) on three-pointers last seasonLacks confidence in his jumpshot and has very limited range. As a result, defenders tend to lay off of him and clog the lane, making it much harder for Syracuse to run their offense. Gaining some kind of consistency/confidence in his jumper so teams have to at least guard him beyond the foul line is not only imperative to Harris NBA future, but also to the success of his Orangemen next seasonShot 68% from the foul line last season, which is not bad considering his dreadful perimeter shooting numbers from the field. His game could take off if he can get his free throw accuracy up another 10%. He has no problem drawing fouls because of his strength, athleticism, and slashing ability, so getting to the free throw line more often would translate into more points and also could give Harris more confidence in his perimeter shotIf Harris stays at Syracuse two or three more years and develops a fairly consistent jumper, he will be one of the premier shooting guard prospects when he enters the draft.",76,220,22.71

Nevill does that very well against smaller defenders. Good around the basket using put-backs, tip-ins and 2nd shot opportunities … Fights well for position on the low post … Offensively he plays and executes well on pick and rolls (sets good screens and rolls to the basket for easy shots; possesses a solid running hook) … Nevill is a decent passer out of the post to cutters or if he gets double-teamed … It’s very difficult to score against Nevill because of his height … Defensively he is an effective shot blocker (good timing) and if he doesn’t block the shot he often alters them … Solid rebounder on both ends on the floor.

Dominic James,-1,"With his insane hangtime, leaping ability, and long arms, hes able to play bigger than his 5-11 size. He also enjoys tremendous lower-body strength, as is evident with his explosive aerial maneuvers, his agility, and ability to absorb contact. His upper-body strength is very good for a college sophomore, and should only get better. James has long arms for his height. He uses his wingspan effectively to deflect passes and gather steals. He is also a surprisingly good rebounder, which is probably mostly due to his agility, hops, and instincts. His arms also enable him to get shots off over bigger opponents. He possesses terrific quickness, aggressiveness, footwork, and anticipation. James shows good patience, and usually does not commit silly fouls. Defensively James could become a very effective full-court presser in the NBA. He also persistently shows a very good effort when fighting through screens or chasing his man around. He also is fairly good at stealing, and is very good at leaking out after a turnover. Offensively, His first step is amazing, which enables him to blow by any defender at the college level. Even in the NBA, he will likely be quicker off the bounce than most point guards. His agility and strength lets him finish very well, especially for a player his size, near the hoop, either on an aggressive drive or backing his man down after a rebound. He also excels at pulling up for midrange j’s, which he hits at a high clip. His half-court passing ability is hard to figure out since he plays off the ball so often. James is a tremendous athlete. Period. He excels at all facets of athletic ability, including speed, agility, leaping ability, hangtime(!), and explosion. Hes simply one of the best athletes in college basketball … James exerts a good effort on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor. He is so naturally gifted on the fast break that he seems to glide effortlessly. He works hard to gain position, especially off of inbounds near the hoop, as he often out-hustles and outsmarts his defender, which enables him to get a quick bucket off the inbounds.","At 5’11"" roughly three-four inches shorter than the average NBA point. His lack of size will make him be a half-court defensive liability, as bigger point guards will easily post him up or shoot over him. James long arms and jumping ability do somewhat mask this weakness in college, but he will have a much harder time hiding it at the pro level. His outside shooting ability is very streaky. Although he is a better stationary shooter then off the dribble or off the catch. James often forces his shots. His free-throw shooting is below average, especially for a 1. He runs the floor extremely well on the fastbreak, usually making good decisions, however, his half-court offense needs much work, as he often rushes shots and sometimes is overaggressive driving. In the NBA, his height will not allow him to see over taller defenders, and the strength and agility of the typical pro guards will disallow him from making the plays that he often makes in college. Despite this, James figures to be an average to slightly above average NBA offensive player, especially if his range and consistency improves. James athletic ability is very useful, but occasionally he gets out of control and turns the ball over While Dominic James occasionally plays the two at Marquette, he lacks the size and shooting ability to do so in the NBA. He will be forever confined to the point James intangibles have come into question. He carries himself with confidence that borders on cockiness, often appearing stubborn. To his credit though, he shows a great deal of emotion and has at least an average basketball IQ.",71,180,22.74
