John Wall,1,"One of the most electrifying players to come out of the college ranks in years … Has an heir of supremacy/confidence that only the truly great ones possess … His speed in the open floor and first step blow by ability is absolutely jaw dropping … His body control and ability to make plays around the rim as well as find teammates with passes while playing at such a break neck speed is what sets him apart. At first you think he’s out of control but he actually makes great decisions while playing at such a fast pace … Fearless attacking the basket off the dribble and seems to find a space in the defense when it isn’t there … His ability to contort his body and finish from all angles around the basket with both hands borders on the absurd … There is a ton of room for growth and improvement, and his style of play (SPEED) is tailor made for the NBA level … Point guards with his size and athleticism are rare, Rose and Westbrook are two of the most athletic lead guards to come along in years, and Wall has some of each of their attributes … Possesses elite athletic ability with unusual length and explosiveness for a point guard … Excellent finisher in transition with both hands and his speed and ability to change direction allows him to get any place he wants on the floor … Pushes the ball up the floor as well as any 6-foot point guard … Can become dominant at both ends of the floor being able to use his length as both a defensive stopper and above average rebounder from the wing … An excellent passer, particularly on the move. Can pick a part a defense setting up teammates for easy scores using his great vision, and creativity … A true floor general, not just an athlete masquerading as a point … Huge hands give him excellent command of the basketball … Good ball handler with either hand … A ball hawk able to rip opposing point guards using his quick hands and feet and long arms. Excellent anticipation on passes contributed to his 1.8 steals per game … Shows leadership ability and will look to become a more vocal leader as he matures … Has a chance to be a merchandising phenomenon with his incredible talent and charisma …","Similar to Derrick Rose entering the league, Wall’s jumpshot is a work in progress … Shooting is the easiest skill to improve upon in the league and Wall’s shooting form is not horrible, but it will require some tweaking and hard work (repetition) in the gym to become a real strength to his game … Wall is not a good set shooter, preferring to create a rhythm using the bounce. His shot lacks great lift and is a little slow to get off. His form and release are decent, but should look to get a little more trajectory … At times it appears Wall is too caught up in impressing instead of focusing on the ultimate goal of winning … More comfortable operating in the open floor than in the half court … Will need to hone his pick and roll skills and half court command of the game … His ability to get into the lane and make plays around the basket in the half court game is more effective than his jump shooting … While possibly even quicker than Rose, he lacks the same body strength and ability to absorb contact. Adding some core body strength would allow him to finish stronger around the rim … Gets careless passing the ball at times. 4 turnovers per game show his lack of ball protection and that his point guard skills are still raw. His 1.6 a/to ratio is solid for a freshman but should be better for such an elite level player … Wall is blessed with such incredible physical gifts that it will be up to him to put in the work to get the most out of his abilities. Too often the most talented players aren’t the ones willing to work the hardest, and at such a young age it’s too early to definitively say whether he ""wants it"" … Competitive player, but will need to develop his killer instinct and ability to take over at the end of games …",76,196,19.81
Evan Turner,2,"Big combo guard with great versatility and a tremendous feel for the game … Extremely smooth with the ball in his hands and has a bag of tricks offensively … His handles are that of a point guards and he has a terrific ability of getting to the basket … Has supreme confidence with the ball in his hands, excellent handle and a nasty crossover … Slick mid-range game with the ability to change directions and get defenders off balance to create looks … Good upperbody strength allows him to absorb contact and make plays at the rim … Strong finisher. Very adept at finishing after contact. Also utilizes the glass effectively … Has a nifty runner when he meets up with shot blockers in the paint … Understands how to use his body to shield the ball from opponents … Has a great pull up jumper and his ability to drive really sets up his ability to pull up for shots … Utilizes the spin dribble to get by opponents effectively and into the paint … Creative playmaker with the ability to find others for shots when his path to the basket gets cut off … Solid vision and a good passer capable of finding the open man … An above average athlete with good speed and long arms … Makes a lot of impressive plays at the basket using excellent body control and creativity … A solid shooter with good form … Has a big wingspan (near 7-foot). His long arms allow him to disrupt passing lanes … Draws a lot of fouls on drives due to his aggressiveness … Runs down a lot of loose balls and makes plays based on sheer desire and hustle … Plays with a high level of intensity at all times no matter the game situation … A student of the game who studies past greats and appears to have a great understanding … Solid free throw shooter at 79% …","Not a freak athlete, but above average by NBA standards with great length … At times appears to be susceptible to being thrown off his game by physical play … A better scorer than shooter, while Turner shot 44% from 3 as a sophomore it was on a low volume of shots … Should look to improve his catch and shoot ability and expand his range and consistency from the perimeter … His effectiveness going towards the basket with the ball probably keeps him from polishing his outside game, but with such efficiency driving it’s hard to ask him to shoot more from the perimeter … Struggled in the clutch in OSU’s loss to Siena in the tournament … At times can fall in love with the dribble and become too ball dependent, but he’s very effective so that’s nit picking to a degree … His creativity can lead to being a little careless passing the ball … Not great at setting defenders up off of screens and shooting spot up. He prefers to create a rhythm with the ball in his hands dribbling off screens or creating off isolation …",79,214,21.67
Derrick Favors,3,"Explosive athlete with unique combination of power and quickness … Possesses an extraordinary wingspan, with Georgia Tech official website claiming a 9-1 standing reach … Tremendous leaping ability … Frequent target of the alley-oop pass and seemingly nothing is out of reach. Soft hands allow him to corral passes most bigs would muff … Runs the floor like a gazelle showing great speed from baseline to baseline … Finishes with power around the rim – a dunking machine … Has made dramatic advancements in his post game repertoire and footwork … Features a drop step into the lane for a mini right hook and quick spins to either side of the floor … Cat quick in the post. Displays a deft touch with his left hand around the basket, almost inclined to use his off hand … Has a nice looking stroke out to 12-15 feet, but does not appear overly comfortable … Appears relaxed at the free throw line shooting 73% early on … An absolute vacuum on both the offensive and defensive backboards. Averaging 8.3 rebounds through his first seven collegiate games in 24 minutes of action (4.4 def and 3.9 off) …  A shot blocking menace (5 per game as a HS senior and 2 per game early this season) … Alters countless other attempts … His mere presence makes opponents think twice before driving inside … Not a boastful personality, but rather allows his game to do the talking … Excellent student and quick learner.","Has done a good job adding bulk to his frame, but needs to continue to get stronger … Needs to increase trajectory on his jumper and increasing his range would be beneficial … Ball handling is decent for a big, but must be improved to augment his face up game … Continued advancement of his footwork and comfort level in the post … Seems to predetermine moves rather than reacting to the defense … Does not handle double teams well … Needs to slow the game down and not panic … Not a great passer out of the post. Has relied heavily on his athletic gifts up to this stage against inferior competition … Needs to work harder and understand court positioning … Can be lazy at times defensively and on the boards depending on his length and leaping ability … Stands too upright and his lateral movement is sloppy … His conditioning has been questioned, often tiring in the latter stages of games.",82,245,18.96
Wesley Johnson,4,"Wes has all the tools, and fits the description of your classic athletic small forward … He’s quick and slippery when maneuvering in the lane … At 6’7, he has a huge wingspan (easily over 7′ feet), and tremendous leaping abilities which allow him to rise above traffic around the rim … He has a smooth and fluent motion on his jump shot, and gets nice elevation … Has a strong mid-range game that will only get better … Can spot up from short or deep, but seems to excel at shooting off one dribble after his quick first step enables him to create space between him and his defender… When he doesn’t shoot off the dribble, he uses an effective jab step to create separation and get off his shot, a must-have tool for a scoring small forward in the NBA … Also has deep range with a high and quick release, and his consistency will only improve – his 3 point percentage has gradually risen from 29% to 33% to 39% respectively in each of his 3 years… He shoots 50% from the field overall, and does not need 20 plus shots to be effective … Extremely unselfish, the offense rarely becomes stagnant when the ball is in his hands, a tendency other teams have when their go-to player tries to isolate himself … An underrated passer showing excellent vision and passing skills for a 3 … He moves extremely well off the ball, and does a great job of getting himself open off back screens … Wes can run the floor and finish effectively in transition … His quickness, awareness and long wingspan come into play defensively as well, as he is a terrific off-ball and help defender … Can quickly move from the weak-side to ball-side, and uses those long arms and high leaping abilities to block an average of 2 shots per game … He’s athletic and long enough to play effective on-ball defense at the next level … His wingspan and leaping abilities also make him an excellent rebounder, and his persistent nature and good nose for the ball make him a pest on theoffensive glass …","Sometimes Wes settles or relies too much on his jump shot, and when it’s not on that day, he can disappear for long stretches throughout the game … Needs to bulk up- when guarded by stronger defenders, he tends to pull back for tougher jump shots as opposed to taking it strong and drawing the foul … Attempts less than 4 free throws per game … Tries to get out of slumps by shooting jumpers instead of being more aggressive … Has not developed much of a back-to-the-basket game yet, but his skills, high release and length give him a shot to develop a post game over time … Has trouble creating off the dribble, most of his opportunities come after one dribble or a catch and shoot … Not much of a playmaker, his ball handling skills are average, and he tends to throw the ball away too often … He’s 23 years old, so his upside and potential might take a hit when GMs look at guys who are up to 3 years younger …",79,206,22.97
DeMarcus Cousins,5,"A physical mismatch in almost every sense. Cousins’ size, power, length and reflexes give him the ability to do things even when he’s not in position to do them … An underrated athlete, despite lacking great explosiveness, he’s extremely nimble and dexterous for such a huge man … His great hands and soft touch, along with his monstrous (7-foot-6) wingspan, allow him to finish easily around the rim … His feet are very quick for a player with so much weight allowing him to react to plays very well … Has a diverse skill set offensively, to go along with great footwork in the paint that makes him much more than just a big body … Extremely adept at finishing after contact … Feels he can score almost every time he gets the ball in the post. He can create for himself with a variety of offensive moves whether its facing up or with his back to the basket … Uses his strength well to overpower opponents and create space to score … Scores about 16 points, gathers 10 rebounds and shoots over 7 free throws in only 23 minutes per game, showing his efficiency and desire to stay active… He is capable of knocking down mid-range jumpers and with his huge wingspan can shoot it over just about anyone … Defensively he can block shots from the weak side as well as on the ball due to his length, and dominate the boards at the college level, while eating up more space than anyone on the court… He’s a defensive presence even if he just stands there with his hands up protecting the rim … Although he averages just 1 assist per game, Cousins shows remarkable passing ability and vision for a bigman. Also can handle the ball very well, even in the open court when called upon. Surprising ball skills for a bigman … Has a mean streak which scouts like to see, he just needs to learn to channel it in a positive way …","Cousins’ lack of maturity and mental focus is evident in his negative body language and lack of composure … He tends to lose his head, looking disinterested or frustrated if things don’t go his way. Also does not appear receptive to coaching, tuning out his coaches when they attempt to give him advice on the bench …  The big question is whether it’s merely a lack of maturity due to age or something deeper … To his credit he made it through the entire season without any suspensions or ejections. However, there were a few times (flagrant fouls) where he may have deserved to be … Free throw shooting, while showing solid form, goes through bouts of inconsistency due to lack of focus.(appears to decrease as games progress) … Occasionally forces the issue when its not there, and tries things that are out of his range … His lateral movement could be a liability when guarding more agile players that can put the ball on the floor … He lacks explosiveness, sometimes looking like he has weights on his feet, which could hurt him offensively as well as when facing up against more versatile big men in the NBA … Lack of great explosiveness also decreases his shot blocking to some extent … Tends to not hustle back on defense and disappear when his head is not in it … Weight could be an issue if he does not learn to become disciplined about diet and off court habits … Will basketball be his primary focus, or living life in the fast lane that accompanies it?",83,292,19.88
Ekpe Udoh,6,"Skilled power forward with a long, lean frame. Has a 7’4 1/2 wingspan … Nicknamed ""The Nightmare"" for his demonic shot blocking prowess (3.7 per game as junior) … Views swatting shots as an art form – always taking proper angles, never leaving his feet until his opponent does, can block shots with either hand and keeps balls in play … Tremendous offensive rebounder as a result of his length and quickness off the floor (3.6 off, 9.8 total) … Exhibits solid agility on the perimeter, able to stay in front of quicker guards on pick and roll switches … Moves his feet well and lateral quickness is much improved … Has made dramatic developments in his offensive repertoire since his sophomore season at Michigan … Much more aggressive looking to score (14 ppg) … Shows the ability to face up opponents with his quick first step and new and improved ball handling skills … His passing ability and court vision have been a revelation, often acting as a facilitator in Baylor’s offense (2.7 ast) … Reads double teams well and finds the open man. His post skills are on the incline exhibiting solid foot work and a series of quick moves … Prefers a one power dribble jump hook. Has nice touch on his short range and mid-range jumper … Has shown flashes of range this season knocking down 7 three pointers. Shooting form is near textbook … Runs the floor very well for a big. His work ethic can be easily detected in his development as a player in a short period of time … Has developed some face the basket skills, but will never be confused for being a small forward …","Despite improvements, still has a very raw offensive game … Has the skills, but many subtleties are not yet second nature. Not smooth in the post, often looking uncomfortable and indecisive on what move to attempt … What is his offensive game? Can do a variety of things, but has no real go to move … Has struggled with turnovers problems, attempting low percentage passes and overdribbling (2.4 to) … Needs to add weight and get stronger, especially in his lower body … Has difficulty holding his ground on defense and maintaining interior position on offense … Does not finish plays through contact … Only attempted 4.5 free throws per game last season … A solid run/jump athlete but lacks explosiveness. Effort on the defensive backboard can be questioned- lackadaisical on box out assignments quite frequently … Does not play with a killer instinct and needs to get tougher … Will turn 23 in May making his upside somewhat limited. Ability to add significant strength at this stage of his development is doubtful.",82,237,23.11
Greg Monroe,7,"Multifaceted lefty big-man with the skill set of a guard … The Georgetown’s Princeton style offensive system goes through him making him the primary decision maker … Unique set of skills. Excellent passer, almost unselfish to a fault. Displays great court vision and knowledge of teammates positioning on the court (2.7 assists per game) … Sneaks passes into extremely tight quarters with perfect placement … Handles the ball very adroitly, especially going to his natural left side … Possesses a versatile offensive game … Has the ability to face up and put the ball on the deck or take opponents into the post … Does not have a singular go to post move, but his unorthodox lefty style allows him to get to his comfort spots … His jump shot is pleasing to the eye, but he rarely shows it … On occasion has shown range out to the college three … Has shown increased aggression attacking the basket midway through his sophomore season … Taking 6 free throw attempts as a sophomore compared to 4.8 as a frosh … Added 25 pounds of muscle toward the end of his High School career … Has very broad shoulders and solid frame … His effort on the boards has been tremendous, turning a once looked upon weakness into a strength (10.2 rpg as a sophomore) … He’s quick off his feet and rebounds well out of his area … Possesses great length with a 7’2 wingspan … Disruptor in the paint with his shot blocking ability (1.6 blocks per game) … Very quick hands (1.7 steals per game) … Runs the floor exceedingly well for a man his size. Solid speed from end to end when he hustles … Has an awkward yet effective style and by all accounts a solid character …","Takes a passive approach to the game … Rarely looks to dominate, choosing rather to take what comes to him and often defers to others. (In fairness, the Georgetown system stresses team play and limits individual creativity) … Lacks the killer instinct to bury his opponent … Often times look disinterested in playing and appears he would rather be some place else … Does not possess explosive athletic ability … His quickness and leaping ability are ordinary by NBA standards … Despite putting on weight, still has difficulty absorbing contact and finishing in traffic … Adding bulk in the past has slowed him down and it’s apparent he’s not a player that can carry any additional weight comforably … No true post game repertoire … His footwork has improved but still needs significant advancements … Very awkward and deliberate in the post … Needs to improve his handle with his off (right) hand … His face up game can be very predictable and he’s prone to turnovers (2.6 per game) when shut off from his original move … Jump shot consistency is a concern … Has an extremely high arch on his shot … Incorporation of a mid-range jumper would be beneficial to his growth … Regression in free throw accuracy is alarming- dropping from 70% to 63% … Does not display his passion for defense on a play in play out basis … Could use an edginess to his game and get his hands dirty more often …",83,247,20.07
Al-Farouq Aminu,8,"One of the top athletes in the country, Aminu had a solid sophomore year, with more opportunities to shine after James Johnson and  Jeff Teague left for the pros …  A huge leaper with freakish athleticism, explosiveness and solid length, Aminu uses these 3 strengths to make him an excellent rebounder and defender …  His athleticism contributes to a quick first step, while possessing a good enough handle to take his defender off the dribble north to south rather than east to west … His solid frame, length and athleticism give him the ability to be an excellent defender, with the option of allowing him to guard the 2, 3 or 4 … His leaping abilities allow him to get up and block shots, as well as eliminate second chance opportunities on the defensive glass … Again he uses his pure athleticism to keep the ball alive on the offensive glass making him a tough target to box out … High energy player, will lay out for the ball … Showed an improved post game, using his quickness to elude his defender down low and get off uncontested shots even with his man on his back … He has a good enough handle to match his athleticism following a rebound, allowing him to go coast to coast where he thrives in transition,  as he runs the floor very well and can soar around the hoop making him a point guard’s best friend on the break …","Aminu’s glaring weakness is his inability to create shots for himself and hit from the outside … He lacks any real range on his outside game, and does not have the ability to pull up off the dribble … He lacks touch around the basket when he’s not close enough to dunk … Turnover prone, with a tendency to be out of control and a bit awkward when taking his man off the dribble … Handle is not diverse enough, most of his drives are made because of a quick first step, while limited to mainly just going right … His lack of shooting ability hurts his chances of playing the 3 at the next level, most likely he will play the athletic and high flying power forward role until he broadens his perimeter skills … Not skilled enough to immediately be effective on the offensive end…",80,216,19.77
Gordon Hayward,9,"The 6-9 Sophomore forward is an outstanding shooter as evidenced by his 84% free throw percentage … He has a high, quick release on his jumper enabling him to get his shot off when he wants … His three-point accuracy has regressed from his freshman to sophomore campaign largely due to opponents contesting a higher percentage of his outside looks … There’s no doubt that he will be able to hit the outside jumper with great accuracy at the next level when getting open looks alongside another playmaker … At the college level he also does a very good job of getting to the free throw line via drives to the basket or by drawing contact from offensive putbacks, 30% of his points come from the charity stripe … Hayward is more than just a shooter as he’s also an excellent offensive rebounder from the SF/wing position, averaging 2.1 offensive boards per game at an 8.5% offensive rebounding percentage … He uses his good size and underrated athleticism to his advantage on the glass as he’s averaging 8.3 total rebounds per game … Gordon’s ball handling ability is also a bit underrated, while he won’t blow by anyone with his quickness, he is an effective ball handler and will initiate Butler’s offense from the point forward position at times … Hayward is also an effective passer with a high basketball IQ, he often defers to teammates and is willing to make the extra pass …","The biggest knock on Hayward’s game is his lack of aggression … He shows it from time to time, but we would like to see him make a more concerted effort to dominate games when his team needs him … He’s a match up problem for many teams at the college level, but his lack of a post game has allowed opponents to guard him with smaller defenders … While we mentioned that he’s a respectable ball handler, he does not look to score very often off of the dribble … He gets to the rim at times in college, but that is not likely to translate to the NBA … Hayward is a decent defender using his size and athleticism to his advantage at the college level … However, his lack of elite lateral footspeed and strength will make it difficult to match up with small forwards in the NBA … Several scouts and knowledgable observers have mentioned that Gordon is ""too nice"" which points to our comment about his lack of aggression … Other questions exist about his commitment to being a great basketball player … He is a very smart kid, majoring in engineering … To his credit he has other interests and will have other options outside of basketball, but he must commit himself if he wants to be an effective player at the next level …",80,211,20.27
Paul George,10,"Paul has some very appealing aspects to his game that could translate nicely to the next level … a 6’8 small forward with a long wingspan and unlimited NBA range, he has a quick release and does not need much room to let it fly … His athleticism and ability to run the floor make him dynamic in transition, resulting in big time dunks that can spark his team … He attempted exactly 132 free throws in both his freshman and sophomore years, however he hit 28 more his sophomore year (a 70% to 91% jump)… Impressive vision and passing skills, which is not usually the case for a perimeter forward (3 assists per game) … Rebounds well for a small forward at over 7 per game … Defensively his athleticism contributes to over 2 steals and almost a block per game, illustrating his ability to anticipate and make a play on the ball …","George’s biggest weakness is his inability to create for himself, and his poor shooting percentage when pulling up off the dribble … Lacks a great handle which limits his overall game, as practically all of his baskets come from spotting up, good position down low, or in transition … Tends to get too trigger happy from behind the arc, rushing long shots as opposed to letting the play develop and waiting for a better option … He needs to not always settle for the long ball, and use his strong body and basketball skillset to be a little more creative in regards to getting easier opportunities and getting to the line … At times he can be sloppy with the ball, throwing unreasonable passes while looking as if his head is not fully in the game…  Defensively, he tends to lose focus when playing on the ball, but with the right coaching staff and the opportunity to play on a bigger stage, that problem is likely fixable … Playing a weak schedule on a small stage makes it difficult to project how he would fare against stiffer competition …",81,214,20.16
Cole Aldrich,11,"Smooth bigman with great length and developing skills who has quickly become the premiere center in the country … Shows solid basketball understanding/fundamentals and a high motor … Made a huge jump during his sophomore season (going from a 3ppg 3 rpg player to 15 ppg and 11 rpg) and appears ready to take his game to another level in his junior season … His long arms (7’4 wingspan) allows him to play a few inches bigger than his 6’11 height and patrol the paint … Has good agility for a player his size and is beginning to develop good body control and offensive moves … His overall feel for the game has begun to come around. His footwork in the post is superb and his post game is starting to become highly efficient … He employs an effective hook shot as well as the ability to step out and hit shots facing the basket … But to his credit he is not overly enamored with drifting away from the basket and focuses on using his size, strength and touch to score easy baskets in the paint … Though the mechanics on his shot aren’t pretty, they are effective … A bigman who runs the floor well and can finish on the break … Shows excellent coordination with the ability to convert plays in both the half court and on the break … Defensively he has become a real presence as a shot blocker using his huge wingspan to inhale close to 3 blocks per game … He shows solid vision finding teammates when he gets doubled and does a good job of finding open teammates cutting to the basket … Soft hands give him the ability to gather rebounds or post passes and limit any fumbling of the ball … Developed very good consistency in his sophomore year scoring in double figures in all but 4 games, and at least 8 points in every game … Highly efficient offensively, shooting close to 60% from the floor … His free throw shooting has shown improvement (68% to 79%) and become very effective … Very solid in most areas … Appears to be all 6’11 that he’s listed and could even potentially measure that barefoot making him a legit 7-footer …","Not overly explosive or a freakish athlete but his length and agility make him very effective … His unorthodox shooting style (has a large range of motion on his shot and follow through) makes him appear to be less coordinated and less efficient than he actually is … Not overly fiery. His demeanor is extremely even keeled ala Tim Duncan, but he shows a competitiveness when challenged … Could look to extend his range out a little ways, but has shown nice development in his short to mid range shot … Shows nice speed in the open floor, however his defensive speed laterally is a little slow. Granted most centers aren’t as fleet of foot as other positions … Has excellent strength for the college level, but will need to continue to bulk up and get nastier to contend with the beasts in the paint at the NBA level … Added strength will also allow him to finish off plays around the basket even more effectively … Developing a nastier on court disposition will help him.

Xavier Henry,12,"Eighteen year old freshman with an effortless, fluid style … His body is NBA ready – built like a freight train possessing tremendous strength … Ideal frame for a shooting guard or small forward at the next level. Naturally gifted scorer (28 ppg as a HS senior) with a deadly shooting eye. Prolific shooter from beyond the arc with tremendous range. Pure stroke with a quick, smooth release. No hitches … Uses his legs very well on his shot getting good lift … Effective slashing to the hoop where he can attack the rim and seek out contact … Finishes extremely well, shrugging off defenders with ease … Gets to the free throw line regularly and is automatic. Active on the glass … Can be a terrific rebounding wing with his strength and freakish wingspan (6.7 per game in 2009 and 7.2 in 2008) … A thief when playing off the ball defensively, reading passing lanes and intercepting passes (1.7 spg through his first seven collegiate games). Refreshing positive attitude on the court. Always smiling, seeming to truly enjoy the game of basketball … Hard worker and very coachable, which is rare for a player of his stature.","A strong athlete but not an elite level athlete … Does not possess explosive speed, quicks or leaping ability, although his leaping ability is better than his foot speed … His first step is mediocre and his face up game lacks creativity … His options are limited when he puts the ball on the floor and is quite predictable … Ball handling needs to improve drastically. Turnovers have been a bugaboo early on at 2 per game … Needs to develop his right hand. Too left hand dominant on the dribble and on the finish … Settles for too many long range shots. Should take advantage of his strength inside and attack more. Lack of comfort in the post game. He has the physical edge against any college SG or SF and would be wise to exploit it … Defense runs through positive and negative patches.

Hits the glass hard and shows a willingness to battle inside … Runs the floor well with both speed in the open floor and good lateral quickness … He’s a top notch shot blocker for a forward due to excellent timing, explosiveness and length … Appears to have a 7-foot-2 wingspan, or close … Does not have a superstar attitude, he has a workman’s approach to the game that is refreshing to see from such a talented player …","Needs to add strength … Does not have a big (wide shoulders) frame so he’s never going to be an overpowering type of post guy, but he can certainly add 20-25 lbs and be a finesse type of 4 ala Chris Bosh … As a freshman he was unable to finish well through contact when attacking the rim on dunks. Added strength will make him a terror around the basket as he’ll be able to fully utilize his great length and improve his finishing ability … Should look to extend his range, developing a consistent mid-range shot … He has good touch and it will likely be a matter of practice and repetition and he will be able to develop a reliable J.

Despite his toughness and lower body strength, he’s not defending 4’s at the next level … He will need to prove he can defend on the perimeter … Appeared lead footed at times when forced to cover quicker opposition at the college level. While he’s an efficient spot up shooter, does not shoot well on the move or off the dribble. Needs time to get his legs underneath the shot. Additional cultivation of the mid-range game will be critical to his success. Did not spend time coming off screens in college, usually acting as the screener … Can he use screens effectively and make shots? His ball handling skills are extremely limited for an NBA SG/SF … Has minimal creativity as a result, and unable to get shots for himself … Dribbles with his head fixated on the ground … Had turnover problems (2 per game) despite limited ballhandling responsibilities … Was the beneficiary of open 3 pt looks floating around the three point stripe when defended by bigs … Open spaces will be few and far between when guarded by players of comparable size … Became heavily reliant on the three rather than using his brute strength inside. Almost 40% of his FG attempts came from beyond the arc … Did not spend enough time on the FT line (3.7 FTA), failing to attempt more than 8 in a game.

Tyren Johnson,-1,"A hybrid forward with terrific length … He has come out of nowhere during his senior season and has almost tripled his scoring production … Playing mostly on the wing, he is able to use his long strides to slither past defenses and get to the basket … He takes full advantage of his long arms to stretch to the basket for finesse finishes … He has a soft touch around the hoop and an uncanny ability to finish difficult shots in the paint … His jumpshot is fundamental and he is able to make shots from beyond the arc … His midrange jumper is also decent and he is able to shoot off the dribble … Can post up smaller defenders, and likes to use a fairly effective turnaround jumper … He draws a lot of defensive attention because of his scoring, and he is able to make the extra pass to an open teammate for easy scores … Rebounds the ball extremely well on both ends of the floor thanks to his wingspan … Causes problems defensively because he can block shots and get into the passing  lanes …","Has an extremely skinny body, making it hard for him to take contact going to the basket … Needs to add mass and bulk to be able to sustain the physical play at the next level … Not a very explosive athlete …  Still a very raw player in terms of skills and basketball IQ … Makes a lot of careless mistakes (both in terms of passing and attacking) … Not great creating scoring opportunities off the dribble (he can handle the ball on occasions, but not comfortable operating off the bounce regularly) …",80,204,21.93

Marqus Blakely,-1,"An outstanding athlete … He put himself on the college basketball map when he had one of the year’s most exciting dunks in 2007 as a freshman during the American East Championship game vs. Albany which was nationally televised … As a sophomore, he garnered both the America East Player of the Year and America East Defensive Player of the Year, which had never been accomplished before in league history .. A quick leaper as his 2.9 blocks per game will attest to … Able to guard both wing and post players effectively … Offensively, he attacks the rim with an attitude and as a result he gets to the free throw line quite often … He is very crafty around the rim and finishes most of his shots (58.3% from the field) … He could be intriguing to some NBA teams looking for defensive help, where Blakely could be very effective guarding a couple different positions.","His offensive perimeter skills are very raw … He is uncomfortable handling the ball on the wing … He rarely puts the ball to the floor more than once or twice … Also, he has yet to show any consistency shooting the ball outside of 12 feet … Ball handling and outside shooting are two aspects of his game that must improve if he is going to have any shot at making an NBA roster … At the college level, his game resides strictly in the paint. At only 6-5, he will not be able to have continued success down in the post as he will be extremely undersized. Poor free throw shooter as well (59%).",77,225,21.68

Raymar Morgan,-1,"A combo forward with nice length and good athleticism … He is most likely a SF at the next level, but he shows the ability to post up and score around the basket … Able to use his lanky arms and quick feet, he can get around defenders on the block and get good looks at the basket … He is most effective in the midrange area, where he can catch the ball and attack 1-2 dribbles to the basket … A terrific finisher around the basket, he has a soft touch and knows how to use angles to convert on plays … He doesn’t need the ball in his hands to be effective, instead he is constantly moving looking to get easy baskets …. Very good in transition, he uses his speed and athleticism to get out on the break and finish at the basket …",Does not posses the ability to create his own offense off the dribble … His handle is very sloppy and his repertoire is extremely limited … His jumpshot is very shaky and he is not effective at all stepping outside the three point arc … Defenders are able to sag off of him and clog the lanes … He suffered through illness in his 3rd season and has never been able to regain the form that he showed during his 2nd season … Has been very up and down ever since and has struggled to put together a string of good performances …,79,210,21.89
Aubrey Coleman,-1,"A well built and explosive scoring guard … Has become a scoring machine in his senior season … Plays with an extremely aggressive demeanor … Looks to attack off the dribble in the half court … Is very dangerous from mid-range, where he can make a variety of tough and contested shots off the dribble … He gets great elevation on his shot and has the ability to hang before releasing … He has a smooth stroke and a high point of release making it very difficult to contain his jumper ….

Marcus Johnson,-1,Johnson is a dynamic run and jump athlete with the ability to shutdown an opponents best wing player Has very long arms and good defensive instincts Can really ignite a home crowd with a thunderous dunk He has worked hard on his jumpshot and can knock down perimeter shots (though he is still rather inconsistent from outside) Has the size and physical attributes to be an excellent NBA 2g …,"Johnson’s problems have nothing to do with his physical abilities, it’s his decision making and skill level that need work … Johnson is very raw offensively. Though his jumpshot is improving, it still has a long way to go Johnsons ball handling and decision making have an even longer way to go, as evidenced by his 0.63 assist to turnover ratio last season He demonstrates good aggressiveness offensively, but at times it seems like he goes out of his way to draw fouls, something a guy who shoots 50% from the line last year and 39% the year before wouldnt ordinarily try to do For a guard, Johnson is an atrocious free throw shooter, and must improve.

Shoots in the mid 70% from the free throw line, and shows range out to 15 feet … He has improved in the pick and roll this season and his familiarity with it should help him at the pro level … Was voted Defensive Player of the Year in the WCC while averaging over 11 rebounds  and 3 blocks per game. Omar plays hard on defense and uses his size and body to box out, explaining his double digit boards.  Demonstrates very strong intangibles (has lost over 60 pounds since his freshman year, strong work ethic, strong leadership qualities, and very good with the media and fans) …","Omar’s body is a work in progress … While he has lost weight, as mentioned above, he still must build strength and muscle while dropping more bodyfat … In addition there are serious questions whether he has the ability to handle NBA speed both on offense and on defense …  At St. Mary’s he was a focal point of a half court offense … Since few teams in the NBA run a half court offense these days, it is imperative that Omar continues to work on his stamina and speed … While he has worked on the pick and roll he is not the passer or the shooter that slower big men such as Brad Miller or Vlade Divac were … He has a slow mechanics on his release which makes it easier to defend, and as with most interior players, does not possess a strong dribble … Scouts have similar concerns on the defensive side for Omar as he appears to be slow laterally and would probably have one of the worst verticals at the NBA draft combine … Despite averaging 3 blocks per game, he will never be a low post intimidator or shot blocker at the NBA level because of his athletic limitations …",82,265,21.65

He has shown excellent improvement in a short time however … His size could cause him some problems with injuries in his career. He is currently injured and at 7-4, his knees and joints will always have added pressure on them.
