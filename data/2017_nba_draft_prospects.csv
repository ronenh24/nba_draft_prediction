Markelle Fultz,1,"Fultz has elite physical tools for an NBA point guard at 6’5” with a 6’10” wingspan … He has big, strong hands, excellent feet, a solid frame, terrific body control, and he absorbs contact very well … He is very imaginite, shifty with the ball in his hands, can finish above the rim with regularity, and is an explosive leaper off of one foot or two feet when he has momentum … Fultz has great extension and finishing ability at the rim due to his length and large hands; his size and length allows him to get off his pull-up jumper and elevate over the top of other guards; also at times will utilize his size advantage in the post against smaller defenders where he can shoot over the top of them … He is a strong, physical player who does not shy away from contact, and he does a great job of going into the chest of the defender and maintaining control in the air so he can finish acrobatically … He uses his size to get to good scoring angles at the rim; his length also allows him to finish at the rim and make it difficult for defenders to contest his shot … Fultz has a very smooth all around offensive game with tremendous scoring instincts and the ability to put the ball in the basket from all three levels consistently … He has the makings of an elite go-to scorer, which is so valuable and rare at the next level … He can be effective playing both on and off the ball as a playmaker or scorer; an outstanding pick and roll player, excellent creativity and decisiveness as a ball handler … He does a great job of changing speeds and getting to his spots on the floor … In transition he pushes the ball up the court, gets downhill, and uses his elite body control to finish at the rim off the break … Fultz’s knowledge of how to use change of speed and directions is unusually advanced for someone his age, a skill that will translate to immediate success at the next level … Off the pick and roll, he does an excellent job reading his defender and has the ability to pull up all the way from three-point range if the guard goes under the screen or if the big man does not come up to help … He also has an excellent hesitation move that freezes the big man when he does come up to help; he has a deadly pull-up jumper off of the hesitation move, similar to the way Kevin Durant used this move so effectively at Texas … Fultz has an assortment of quick dribble moves from stepbacks, crossovers, spin moves, etc. if the guard gets through the screen … He’s also comfortable using his size, particularly when getting into his mid-range pull up; covers ground very well, uses long strides and consistently gets to the rim in one dribble when penetrating off the pick and roll … He has unique change of direction ability as well, which he uses in the paint to get by bigger defenders … He is a talented isolation scorer who uses hang dribbles and hesitations effectively; can make tough shots off the dribble; able to rise into jump shots off a one-two step and is comfortable making contested jumpers … His respectable pull-up game allows him to get to the rim much more easily when in isolation situations … He does a great job utilizing hesitation crosses to get in the lane and score; also does an exemplary job of being deceptive and unpredictable off the dribble … It is difficult to defend him because of his wide variety of dribble moves … He is not an elite catch and shoot player but more than capable of knocking spot up shots down from the perimeter … He has smooth mechanics with NBA range; also does a good job of knocking down shots when coming off screens where he has excellent balance and shot preparation … He’s very good at attacking closeouts as well, to pull up or finish at the rim … His great instincts are particularly shown in these situations; crafty finisher at the rim, has soft touch on two foot floaters with good balance; can stretch in the air around long defenders with his length; great finisher with his left hand where he gets excellent extension … Fultz is a creative, willing passer with an outstanding feel for the game; has a higher assist percentage and lower turnover percentage than Lonzo Ball … He will be a dangerous playmaker with NBA spacing and better shooters around him … He is dynamic in the open court and can make passes from numerous angels in transition … He does a great job of keeping his head up and finding big men running the floor or shooters on the wings in transition … He is also a terrific passer off the pick and roll, where he uses creative wrap around passes; will split the defenders off of ball screens and find big men in the short corners for easy conversions … Fultz is very patient off the pick and roll and does not force the issue often;will wait for the play to develop before making passes. He does a good job of using both sides of the floor and can make passes over the top due to size and length. Fultz must improve his focus and intensity, but he has the tools to develop into a lockdown defender at either guard spot; uses his body well to stay in front and has quickness to run stride for stride with smaller guards. His 6’10” wingspan makes him tough to shoot over; does a good job of being physical with bigger guards inside and can make things tough for big guys down low off of switches. He can cover a lot of ground, as shown by several chase down blocks this past season at Washington; also shows good instincts off the ball and has good timing on rotations from the weak side in the half court; a very low risk, high reward player; one of the most complete college guards in the last decade.","Fultz is a very hard worker off the court who has shown dramatic improvement each year since his days in high school, but he can play with more consistent intensity in games … The game comes too easily for him, and he can take plays off particularly on the defensive end … He can be loose with the ball at times on offense … Especially turnover prone on his spin dribble … While fairly quick with his feet and creates extremely well with decption and hesitation, he’s not the fastest player running in the open floor … Fultz played on a bad Washington team but some question whether he can lead a team the way a star should at the next level given the low number of wins this past season … On defense he can be a little too upright at times, which causes him to struggle containing the dribble; his closeouts on perimeter can be lazy and out of control … He does not always fight through screens, allowing shooters to get open looks or quick guards to turn the corner; will lose focus of his man often when off the ball, frequently beat on backdoor cuts … Fultz is not overly turnover prone, but he can telegraph passes at times and be a bit lazy in this area, leading to avoidable turnovers … His shot selection is poor at times, but this may have been the result of having to carry the team at Washington … He will settle for a lot of tough mid range jump shots; has greatly improved shooting but still a bit streaky, more of a tough shot maker than pure shooter at this stage … He has a tendency to shoot on the way down on pull-up jumpers … He misses short a lot and needs to put more of an emphasis on getting legs into his shot … Fultz does not have the quickest first step and struggles to turn the corner against more athletic defenders … Will have to rely more on craftiness and deception to become an elite scorer in the NBA …",76,190,19.08
Lonzo Ball,2,"At 6’6"" with a 6’9"" wingspan, Ball has a unique set of physical tools for a point guard that will provide him with a number of advantages in the pros … One of the first things that stands out about Ball is his elite transition play … It starts with his ability to force turnovers and haul in defensive boards to push the ball up the floor and begin the break … He also has tremendous speed in the open floor when the ball is in his hands, but the skill that truly transcends above all other players his age is his elite vision, creativity and passing ability … Not only does he demonstrate the ability to deliver exceptionally accurate passes, but his knowledge of when to push the ball up the floor himself and when to give it up to his teammates is impeccable … He always knows where his teammates are on the floor and gets them the ball in spots they are comfortable … In a basketball sense he’s playing chess, while his peers are playing checkers … Ball constantly moves the ball, makes quick decisions, and has extremely rare vision for a player his age … He has excellent ball-handling ability, but does an exemplary job of not over dribbling and keeping everyone involved … He is also very efficient in transition where he posted an outstanding 4.1-to-1 assist to turnover ratio … The half court is where Ball is a more polarizing player, with transparent strengths and weaknesses to his game … His greatest strength in the half court is still his court vision and creativity prowess … At 6’6” he has the size to see over the defense and find shooters on the perimeter or make entry passes to the post … He also has the basketball IQ to see plays before they happen, which is not something you see often from a such a young point guard … More impressively, his willingness to move the ball was contagious, as UCLA’s offense featured constant fluidity and unselfishness from everyone on the floor … Ball might have the most unorthodox shooting mechanics you will ever see, but he is still a tremendous shooter, particularly off the catch and from long range … Ball connected on 41.2% of his 194 three-point attempts this past season, many of them from far beyond NBA range … Despite his odd shooting motion, he releases the ball squared to the basket and gets great rotation on his ball … In addition, Ball is an above average shooter on the move, as he does a good job getting his feet underneath him when coming off of a screen … He also has a lethal step-back jumper, which is one of his go-to scoring options in isolation situations or off the pick and roll … The combination of his deep range and comfort with the step-back can be a tough guard for opposing defenses … One, perhaps unexpected, area where Ball contributes offensively is cutting off the ball, resulting in easy conversions off of lob passes to the rim … In his one season at UCLA, he proved to be a much better athlete than most thought coming out of high school … Ball understands the use of deception and has a real knack for lulling his defender to sleep off the ball, then using hard backdoor cuts to create scoring opportunities … Ball will fit well in the modern up-tempo NBA game today …","Ball has an outstanding combination of size, length, and athleticism, but his frame is not filled out yet, and he can struggle with more physical guards at times … This also hinders his ability to consistently get into the paint off the dribble … Wears a leg sleave and his legs appear to be underdeveloped … He has terrific speed but does not possess the quickest first step, which will make it more challenging to put pressure on the defense in the NBA … The biggest knock on Ball at this stage is his inability to consistently create his own offense when things break down … Ball is not great in isolation and generally his pick and roll possessions end up as a passer … He very infrequently used the pick to get into the paint and find his own offense … He also rarely showed signs of any mid-range game or the ability to pull up off the dribble … Ball will likely need to play alongside several other offensive threats to be able to generate his own offense in spurts … Where his awkward shooting mechanics can be exploited is off the dribble … On the one hand, Ball converted on 48.6% of his jumpers off the dribble, a number that was near the top in college basketball … However, rarely did he attempt such shots this season, and most of them were step-back three pointers rather than mid range pull ups … His inability to pull up in the mid-range is a function of his extremely slow shooting mechanics. Ball’s low release point and need to come back across his body certainly seem to factor into his inability to get his jumper off when pulling up off the dribble, and he has almost no in-between game because of it … He will need to develop a somewhat quicker release if he ever wants to be effective in this facet of the game … A lot of Ball’s baskets in the half-court at the rim were assisted, which indicates his ability to move off the ball along with his struggles creating his own shot off the dribble … On the defensive side of the court, Ball is adept at forcing turnovers, but he does not have the overall impact that his physical tools would suggest … Ball struggles at times containing dribble penetration against quicker guards, which was particularly exposed against De’Aaron Fox, who exploded for 39 points against him in the NCAA Tournament … Ball also does not have great awareness when being screened, and he also could show more consistent effort to fight through screens and recover … Ball is an intriguing prospect, but his weaknesses are well documented, and he will need to be surrounded by the right personnel to achieve optimal success … Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounding Ball has nothing to do with his game whatsoever … Some NBA execs view his father, LaVar as a potential problem with his ""over involvement"" and the endless controversial comments he has made over the last few months … The hope is that he will fade into the background and not be too involved with Lonzo’s day to day decision making, and ultimately career. Time will tell …",78,190,19.67
Jayson Tatum,3,"Tatum lived up to lofty expectations placed upon him in his freshman season at Duke, as a result of being heralded as a top-five high-school recruit by virtually every recruiting database … Despite the fact that he missed the first eight games of the season with a foot injury, Tatum developed into an absolute superstar by the end of the season for the Blue Devils, averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 boards, and 2.3 assists per game … Tatum’s NBA potential begins with his prototypical physical profile for a wing player … Standing at 6-8, with a 6-11 wingspan, he has an excellent frame that appears will fill out over time with broad shoulders and great hip mobility for his size … Tatum is a fluid athlete with long strides in the open court and the ability to cover a lot of ground … Another great tool Tatum offers is his ability to play small ball four man in short stretches like he did frequently at Duke. His uncommon skillset is visible right away in his ability to corral defensive rebounds and push the ball up the court effortlessly in transition … He is also great on the fast break off the ball, as he understands how to fill lanes correctly and get himself an easy finish at the rim … His impressively long strides also come to play in the half court, where he can catch from the arc and get all the way to the tin in one dribble … He has great extension when finishing at the rim, and his long wingspan allows him to finish above the rim in space … Tatum’s most intriguing selling point, however, is his highly advanced offensive skillset in the half court, and his NBA ready scoring ability … He is an exceptionally polished scorer for a 19 year old, having the ability to operate from all three levels. He is at his best in the mid-range area where he can create space and shoot over the top of the defense with a high release point on his jumper … He also has outstanding footwork and is never too sped up by the defense … Tatum excels out of the mid-post area as well where he has a variety of moves in his arsenal to beat his man … One of his weaknesses coming out of high school was his below average spot-up shooting from three-point territory … Tatum has improved in this area, as he is most certainly a capable threat from deep, especially off the drive and kick … He has also always been a terrific free-throw shooter (84.9% this season), which provides plenty of promise for further improvement down the road … He is also a good pick and pop threat when needed to play the four … He is particularly strong with his one dribble pull-up jumper going to his left, and he just does a great overall job of attacking hard closeouts with superb footwork … Tatum is probably the best isolation scorer in the draft as well … He utilizes a variety of hesitation pull-ups, jab steps, step backs, crossovers, spins, etc., and he can stop on a dime with ease to get into his shot … He was an absolute nightmare four opposing four men to guard, especially in the mid range, where he used his shiftiness and creativity to get into his mid-range game at will … He also is great at changing speeds in isolation situations to keep his defender off balance and get to the rim … Tatum is a handful to guard when facing up in the post … Defenders have to respect his ability to rise into his jump shot, but he counters this well with an explosive first step off the dribble going to his right … He also employs an occasional Dirk-like fall away jumper that is nearly impossible to guard, and he is great overall feel for where the defender is when posting up … He is still improving as a playmaker, but he has good vision in transition and can see over the top of the defense off the pick and roll … Tatum also has the tools to hold his own on the defensive end in the NBA as well in large part due to his size and length … He slides his feet very well when locked in and uses his length to his advantage (1.4 blocks and 1.6 steals per 40 minutes) … He can cover a lot of ground when closing out on shooters, as he would often run all the way from the ball side of the court and force a difficult shot when the ball was skipped over to his man … He also has the agility to contain quick perimeter players off the dribble and the length to consistently force contested shots … He shows flashes of great instincts and can cover a lot of ground rotating from the weak side to protect the rim … Tatum has good hands off the ball and anticipates passing lanes well … He proved to be a factor on the defensive glass, posting a clip 7.2 d-boards per 40 minutes … His professional approach to the game and work ethic are also noteworthy … He consistently demonstrated the ability to stay calm in pressure situations and come up big in crunch time … His game will fit well in the NBA, and he should be an immediate impact scorer … He is one of the more unique players in this draft and can be considered a low-risk, high-reward player …","One of the first flaws that jump out in Tatum’s game is his inconsistent intensity on defense … At times, he seems to just go through the motions defensively and didn’t demonstrate the competitive desire to lock his man down … In addition, he is an excellent small-ball four on offense, but the same cannot be said about his defensive impact from this position … He is not physical enough to handle bigger players down low, and he needs to add some strength to his lower half … His technique on the perimeter can improve, as his closeouts can be quite lazy, allowing for his man to get by him with little resistance … He is also not the most physical perimeter defender and can do a better job of getting in his stance and containing the dribble … In transition, he does not always sprint back to the paint to help out against penetrating guards in the open court … In an NBA game nowadays that is heavily predicated on up-tempo offense with an abundance of quick guards who love to get in the lane on the break, this is something that he must address … One of the other question marks is that he is still a streaky spot-up shooter … He shot 34.3% from the arc at Duke this past season, which is not bad, but it is not good enough to classify him as an elite knockdown shooter … He is much better as a mid-range shooter and there are questions about if he will be able to adapt to the expanded three-point line in the NBA … Off the catch, his mechanics do not look quite as fluid when he is contested, and he is not always balanced on his release, which can also be a bit quicker … He also must become a more reliable scoring threat off the pick and roll … In these situations, defenders would mostly go under the ball screen, and he frequently would not make them pay with his pull up when this happened … Tatum also was guarded mostly by power forwards, so there are concerns about whether he will be able to create offense as effectively against NBA caliber wing players … His handle can be tightened, as he plays a bit too upright with the ball, making him less explosive … He does not have great burst from a stand still position, which causes him to struggle getting to the rim, and he has trouble finishing against top tier length and athleticism … This forces him to heavily rely on tough floaters and two-point jumpers, which is an inefficient way to score … Tatum can further refine his decision making on offense, as he can be too dependent on isolation offense, even if he excels in these situations … He is not the most comfortable playmaker on the move, and because of his inconsistent spot-up shooting in addition to that; there are questions about his effectiveness off the ball … These few factors will determine how high Tatum’s ceiling is …",80,205,19.32
Josh Jackson,4,"One of the main things that jumps out at you is JJ’s versatility on both sides of the ball … From an offensive standpoint, he possesses a very high Basketball IQ that allows him to be aware of where his teammates are on the court … While he doesn’t play the role of a primary ball handler for Kansas, he’s averaging a very impressive 3.1 assists per game … He gets many of these due his natural knack of knowing where everyone is on the court, and having the touch and creativity to get the ball where it needs to go … His motor also jumps off the page, he’s an elite offensive rebounder for a 6’8’’ wing and is extremely assertive when he’s on the hunt for a loose ball, or rebound … Jackson also has a very solid first step, and the ball handling ability to get past defenders at a level that looks to translate to the NBA … He also plays within himself with the ball in his hands … He’s shown takeover ability this season for the Jayhawks, but for a freshman averaging 15.3 ppg, he’s very controlled, and doesn’t have the tendency to get sloppy for the sake of getting a shot … He’s an extremely disruptive and explosive defender too, with a solid 6’9.75’’ wingspan, which will aid him in his NBA translation … He’s not the type of defender that merely hinders his opponents ability to score, he’s deadly in the passing lanes, and is aggressive trying to steal the ball and deflecting passes … This results in a lot of fast breaks, and easy transition buckets … His shot blocking ability is also very impressive for a wing … Jackson blocks 1.5 shots per game (to go with 1.5 steals) and has the ability to get them in one on one situations, or coming over from the weak side … Jackson has also played 3 positions for Kansas this year ranging from the 2, to a small ball 4 … He looks to only be able to play shooting guard and small forward in the NBA, but he can do so effectively on both sides of the ball … Athletically he’s explosive, quick, and has good lateral, as well as open court speed … His assertiveness, and aggressive tendencies pair with his athletic gifts making him a regular on highlight reels, and this is a valuable quality in regards to team momentum … Has a blue collar work ethic and willingness to do the dirty work, does not exhibit the prima donna attitude often associated with elite level prospects … An extremely competitive and passionate kid who brings a high level of intensity and desire to improve …","Jackson’s biggest weakness right now is his shooting … While his athleticism, and his ability to play within himself leaves him with a .52% FG clip, he’s shooting just 28% from deep, and 54% from the charity stripe … His shot is not broken or beyond fixing, and he does have touch, but it does have a little hitch that will take time to correct … His aggressiveness is more often than not a good thing, but this can render him in foul trouble, which can frustrate him … He’s picked up 3 technical fouls, all due to frustration of foul calls, through Jan 7th of 2017 … He’s picked up 4 or more fouls in 5 out of Kansas’ first 15 games, and fouled out of three, so cutting down on fouls early in games will be key … Jackson is a pretty good rhythm jump shooter, and has real potential shooting off the dribble, so the honing of his shot is key to him taking the step beyond a high level two way role player and an All-Star level player …",80,205,20.38
De'Aaron Fox,5,"De’Aaron Fox is a kid that plays with a great attitude and enthusiasm … He has an excellent combination of size, length, and athleticism … At 6’3” with a 6’6.5” wingspan he has a great set of physical tools for a lead guard … His 8’4 standing reach is solid size for a 2-guard … Where Fox particularly stands out, however, is his elite end to end speed in transition that drew numerous John Wall comparisons during his freshman season … He also has an outstanding first step from both a stand still position and off the dribble and is an explosive leaper with the ability to finish above the rim regularly … He is an absolute blur with the ball in the open court and has great shiftiness that allows him to get to the rim at will … Fox also has a tight handle and does a terrific job of changing gears; his ability to play slow to fast is partly what makes him so difficult to stay in front of … When he has a driving lane to the basket he shows tremendous burst and change of pace before turning in frequent emphatic finishes at the rim … In the half court, Fox’s speed is just as useful … He is gifted with tremendous burst that makes his ball handling ability even more effective, allowing him to get into the paint off the dribble, even without a ball screen. He projects to be among the NBA’s most elusive guards from day one … His elite burst and ball handling allow him to create via the pick and roll or isolation (21.2 points per 40 minutes), and he does a good job of drawing contact and getting to the free throw line (7.5 free throw attempts per 40 minutes) … Fox still needs to add more consistency with his shot, but he is a capable mid range shooter off the dribble with sound mechanics … His jumper in the long run is encouraging as he gets great elevation and releases the ball high … When he cannot get all the way to the rim, he utilizes an impressive floater with good touch … He combines his quickness with the ability to drive with either hand, and he does a great job of changing gears with the ball in his hands … He uses a variety of dribble moves and counter moves to freeze his defender from hang dribbles, hesitations, hard crosses, in and outs, etc … Fox also demonstrates great footwork on his crossover into his pull up jump shot, where he is capable of knocking it down if the defense sags off too far … Off the pick and roll, he is an absolute mismatch for big men that occasionally get caught switching on him; he will use hard in and out dribbles that cover a lot of ground to blow by defenders and get to the basket … He can also cover a lot of ground with the dribble and rarely is there any wasted movement with the ball … Despite being taller for a lead guard, he has a low dribble that makes him much more explosive and difficult to contain … He is constantly keeping the defense guessing by playing high to low and slow to fast, which really aids him when his jumper is not working for him … Fox is not an elite facilitator yet, but he has solid vision (5.8 assists per 40 minutes) … His ability to collapse the defense on the drive points towards high upside as a playmaker … He also has the size to see over the top of the defense with an improving pick and roll game as well … Fox has good vision in space and always keeps his head up in transition, showing the ability to deliver accurate passes with either hand to teammates running the floor … Fox has outstanding potential as a defender as well with his size, length, lateral quickness, and instincts … He also has elite reaction time with quick hands and high activity off the ball … At times he will pressure full court and make it very difficult for opposing ball handlers to initiate an offense … He shows great motor in this end of the court as well, as he does en exemplary job of helping off the ball, and still closing out to his man under control when the ball is kicked out. He does an outstanding job of stopping his man’s first move and forcing him to change directions … He anticipates passing lanes very well and has active hands on the ball to force turnovers …","The biggest obstacle for Fox in his transition to the NBA is his lack of a consistent jump shot … Fox made just 31% of his pull-up jumpers, and 20% of his spot up attempts in the half court this season, but he connected on a far more respectable 55% and 36% of those attempts respectively in March … When his jumper is not working, his half-court scoring becomes much more limited and the defense can sag off of him, which somewhat negates his elite quickness … One piece of his shot that he could fix is his tendency to flex his elbow too more, creating almost a slingshot-like release … Fox does not have NBA range at this stage and is much more effective inside the arc; he needs to work on being balanced more consistently on his pull-ups … Fox still is learning to find the right balance between scoring and facilitating … He has a tendency to get too sped up when going to the rim and be a little out of control … He does not always anticipate a play well before they happen, and he can work on his timing with passes … He could also work on his timing and patience off the pick and roll, as he can be especially turnover prone in this department … Fox is still young but he will need to add strength and fill out his wiry frame to hold up over time against the bigger guards in the league … He may struggle initially with bigger guards on defense and finishing through contact in the NBA … He has potential to be a lockdown defender, but sometimes he can be a bit too upright on the ball, which mitigates his lateral quickness …",75,170,19.52
Jonathan Isaac,6,"A ""tantalizing"" prospect, Isaac has a rare combination of size, length, and fluidity for wing player, in many ways similar to Kevin Durant at the same age from a physical and skill standpoint; at 6’10.5” with a 9’0.5” standing reach … He has the size to play the four (and possibly even 5) when necessary and be a presence inside once his frame fills out, but he also runs the floor like a natural wing player … Isaac has long strides, is light on his feet, and can get up and down the floor in a hurry … He has uncommon quickness for a player his size, which he utilizes very well when cutting off the ball to lose his man and create easy looks … Isaac is a quick jumper and shows good vertical explosion, particularly off of two feet when he has momentum to the basket … His length and athleticism also point towards potential as a rebounder … He showed flashes on the glass regularly at Florida State, averaging 9.6 rebounds per 40 minutes, and should develop into an even more potent rebounder as he matures … On the perimeter, he can be a mismatch, as his size and length give him the ability to get his shot off over just about any wing defender … Isaac’s jumper looks promising and should become even more dangerous with time and repetition … He is not going to be a 40-plus percent shooter from three-point land right away, but he has clearly established himself as a threat from outside (1.7 made threes per 40 minutes) with the ability to make tough pull-ups and fadeaways … Isaac is also a sound ball-handler and despite not having carte blanche at Florida State, he has shown the ability to create his own shot with a variety of moves … His ability to pull up off the dribble is extremely intiguing … He utilizes hesitations, crossovers and step backs with crisp footwork to blow by or separate into a jump shot … These flashes of shot creation at his size fuel his scoring potential and drive his potential through the roof … He does not have the most advanced feel for the game yet, but he also shows flashes as a facilitator … As a shooter he is a bit streaky but shows good shot preparation and balance with a high release … He has excellent slashing ability as well and does a great job attacking closeouts with long strides … Isaac also has a quick first step and a strong rip through move that gives him good momentum when driving to the basket … However, he is more than just a straight-line driver; he does a great job of changing speeds and directions with a variety of dribble moves, and he has excellent hip mobility … He can also shoot over the top of smaller defenders while posting up with his size and length … His size also helps him as a passer, as he can see over the top of most defenders; and has good vision … The potential for Isaac as a defensive stopper is also very intriguing … He has the tools to eventually become a player that can lock down multiple positions … He moves laterally quite well and should become a valuable switchman off the pick and roll … He has the agility and foot speed to contain smaller players on the perimeter but also has the size and reach to give bigger players a hard time down low … He is not ready to play down low regularly, but he is long and agile enough to provide glimpses of rim protection when needed to play the 4 …  He is a late bloomer that was a 6’3” guard in high school and is just scratching the surface of his abilities … Players with his combination of size, length, fluidity, and skill are extremely rare, and he will be a great fit in today’s NBA … If he can put it all together, he will be a star … Isaac’s overall upside is off the charts and may be higher than any player in this draft, and in the right situation he may ultimately end up the best player …","Isaac still has not grown into his own body yet, and is very thin for his size at only 205 pounds … He has a lot of skill but has to rely on finesse a bit too often rather than physicality … He struggles on the interior as a 4 man due to a lack of strength and toughness, and he can be pushed out of his spots pretty easily on offense … For example, he lacks the core strength to get all the way to the rim against physical defenders and can get knocked off course, especially when he elevates … Isaac has a tendency to shy away from contact and often will not explode all the way to the rim even when he has his man beat … On the interior he struggles to hold his position when posting up and will settle for fall away jumpers rather than getting to the basket … Though he has potential on defense, he allows himself to be screened easily and lacks the physicality to fight through screens … He also lacks the strength to guard the post with consistency, which limits his ability to play the four regularly … His lack of strength also affects him on the glass, where he can get bullied often and pushed out of position … He also does not always box out and relies too much on his length to track down misses … He still needs to become a more consistent shooter to become a truly reliable threat from the outside, and he is not a great ball handler under pressure … He has a tendency to settle for tough jumpers even when he has an open lane … He does not always read and react to the defense well and can waste dribbles without covering any ground … He may be best suited as a mismatch four man at the next level rather than a pure wing player, as he has a solid handle but does not always get somewhere with the dribble … He needs to become stronger with the ball as well … Isaac has good vision with the potential to become a solid playmaker, but right now his timing and accuracy are not great, and he can put his teammates in bad spots at times … He can also improve his discipline on the defensive end … He will bite on too many fakes on the perimeter and takes poor angles on the ball … He gets lost off the ball too often and needs to do a better job of seeing his man and the ball simultaneously … Isaac has loads of talent, but he has a bad habit of disappearing for stretches, especially after a bad play or two … He can improve his ability to move on to the next play … He will need to learn to stay locked in and focused for the entire game to become more consistent and reach his full potential … While his ceiling is substantial, his readiness is not where some of his peers in this draft are at, giving him a bigger basement as well, and greater risk …",82,210,19.73
Lauri Markkanen,7,"Markkanen was one of the top freshmen in college basketball last season, despite a middle of the year shooting slump, scoring 15.6 points per game on 42% shooting from beyond the arc … Markkanen’s combination of size and skill makes him one of the more intriguing prospects in the draft, and he will have the chance to develop into a valued stretch-four man in the Association … He is mature young man and appeared to be an exceptionally focused and likable teammate in his one year at Arizona … Markkanen’s upside starts with his outstanding size for an NBA power forward at 7-0 and 230 pounds … He is a fluid athlete with great coordination for his size … Most of the intrigue with him, however, is his unique offensive skillset … Markkanen is a high-IQ player that knows how to play the game very efficiently … As mentioned above, Markkanen shot 42% from distance on 5.9 attempts per 40 minutes, and he may actually be the best shooter in this draft regardless of position … He has smooth mechanics, a soft touch, and good balance off the catch … He is not only lethal off the catch, but he is also a prolific shooter on the move off of screens, pull-ups, face-up jumpers out of the post, etc … He particularly showed these abilities off earlier in the year when teammate Allonzo Trier was out for the earlier part of the season, causing him to play a lot of small forward and rely on more perimeter scoring … With more spacing at the NBA level, he will be a tremendous pick and pop threat and be able to maximize his shooting ability … Markkanen moves well without the ball when looking to spot up from the perimeter, and he knows how to find the open spot on the arc to get off a good look … His mechanics also stay consistent even when his shot is contested … He always gets his feet under him and does not waste any motion from catch to release … He runs off of screens like a guard, as he gets his feet set quickly and appears to be very comfortable rising into his shot here … In addition, he has great footwork when chased off the three-point line and can effortlessly shoot the ball off the dribble, especially going to his left … He even showed flashes of pull-up jumpers as a pick and roll ball handler in his arsenal, something extremely rare for his size … His agility for his 7-0, 238 pound frame jumps out, as he is decently effective off the bounce, which will be key for him going forward when defenders chase him off the arc … He has a pretty quick first step that is definitely good enough to get by many of the players that will be guarding him in the NBA … He is very good going to his left with the ability to put it on the floor and finish going left just as comfortably as he does with his right … Markkanen is not a high level athlete, but he can finish above the rim in space due to his superior height and decent leaping ability for his size … He also does a solid job of attacking the offensive glass for a stretch-four man … He does a great job of stepping out and hedging ball screens as well, a situation he will probably be in quite often in today’s pick and roll heavy NBA. Markkanen’s role in the NBA will be clearly defined as a stretch-four man, who can thrive in the role of instant offense off the bench or something along the lines of what Ryan Anderson brings to Houston …","As skilled as Markkanen is on the offensive end, he offers nowhere near the same potential on defense … His lack of strength is a major soncern as he gets toseed around pretty easily by NCAA bigs and already has filled out with broad shoulders … His core and leg strength need a lot of work, and may never allow him to battle inside against the NBA’s top post players … He does not have great length, limiting his ability to protect the rim, and being thin for his height, he plays a lot smaller than his size … He may be more of a mismatch as a stretch-five man on offense, but the flip side is that he may not have any chance to slow down most centers on the defensive end … As mentioned, Markkanen’s lack of a strong base hinders his ability to battle for position in the post … He is also not very physical down low, and he does not have the length to contest shots from other post players to make up for his inability to fight for good position … Combine his lack of length with just average timing and instincts, and he could be a potential liability on this end of the court … On the perimeter he has good feet, but he has a tendency to bend his back instead of his knees to get down in his stance, which eliminates some lateral quickness and effectiveness … He is a nightmare to guard as a stretch-four on offense, but he often gets lost when trying to defend opposing stretch-fours on the perimeter … His intincts in defending the pick and roll and knowing when to come help from the weak side also needs to improve … His rebounding ability is also less than stellar for many of the same reasons that his defensive upside is limited … Markkanen averaged an underwhelming 9.3 rebounds per 40 minutes, as he lacks the length, range, and toughness to be a force in this department … He does not always work hard to get great position when the shot goes up, nor does he have the necessary frame to push opposing big men out of position … Scouts also question how much more there really is to his offensive game than just his shooting ability … He does not appear to have much of a post game, other than simple jump hooks and turnaround jumpers and is not a great finisher in traffic … Not the most vocal or demonstrative person, will need to work on being more assertive and vocal on the floor … He also is not a very gifted playmaker at this stage (1.2 assists per 40 minutes) and he goes left most times he puts the ball on the floor … He is much better attacking off the dribble from the catch than in isolation situations, and he does not look nearly as natural shooting the ball when going to his right hand … Aside from the defensive concerns, he also must develop his offensive repertoire outside of his jump shot.",84,230,20.1
Frank Ntilikina,8,"Elite size for a point guard with very good athleticism and quickness … Impressive wingspan (close to 7 ft)… Very mature for his age with a good basketball IQ … He has a thin frame, but his body structure suggests that he can add weight and increase his muscle tone nicely … A true point guard with a “pass first” mentality … He can control the pace of the game nicely … Excellent passer with great court vision … He is always looking to find the open teammate … He can pass on the move and also while penetrating … Excels on the open court and loves to run the break … Great ball handler … He has a nice hesitation dribble and he has also an improving crossover dribble on his repertoire … Possesses an explosive first step … Really good on ISO situations thanks to his athleticism, length and excellent ball handling … He can create his own shoot and score off the dribble from mid-range and has also a floater as a counter move … When he has time to gather he can finish strong at the rim… Improving 3-point shooter… He is already very good on Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler, because he shows patience and is always looking for the right choice … His body and physical tools are his biggest weapons on Defense … He has great lateral quickness which helps him stay in front of his man … When he is motivated on Defense he can be a lockdown defender … His length and athleticism help him make a lot of steals … Versatile defender with the potential to guard multiple positions in the future … He has a high upside…","He really needs to add some muscle to his body or else he could have problems at the next level … He hasn’t been tested at a senior level yet … His shooting release looks a little odd at times and that’s the main reason he isn’t a consistent shooter from long range yet … He needs to become more vocal and learn when he has to take over a game … At times he is too unselfish and too keen to pass the ball and as a result he looks passive … He must add some aggressiveness to his game … He has problems finishing through contact at the rim due to his thin body and at times he looks like he is even avoiding contact, settling for a mid-range shot … He has problems against physical game … He isn’t always focused on defense … At times he forgets to keep a low stance when he is guarding his opponent and as a result he can be crossed easily … He relies too much on his length to make steals when he gets crossed, which leads to bad fouls … He has problems defending the Pick and Roll, looking lost at times … Stronger players can post him up",77,190,18.92
Dennis Smith,9,"Smith is arguably the most explosive athlete in the draft, despite tearing his ACL a little over a year ago … He is very shifty with the ball in his hands and has tremendous burst … An elite level athlete who attacks the rim like a player 5 inches bigger … Possesses solid size for a PG at 6’2 in shoes with a 6’5 wingspan and 8’1 standing reach … He is also a strong, physical guard with the ability to absorb contact and finish acrobatically at the rim (61% at the rim) … Smith has outstanding leaping ability off of both one or two feet, which led to numerous highlight reel dunks in his freshman year at NC State … He also has the strength, quickness, and speed to be an excellent on ball defender when locked in … Smith is a nightmare to guard in the open court with and his ability to change gears with power … He also attacks the rim fearlessly off the bounce where he can finish explosively above the rim with regularity … He also has an excellent first step from a stand still position and can cover a lot of ground with the dribble … He does a great job of inviting contact and getting to the free throw line frequently (6.9 free throw attempts per 40 minutes) … Smith’s strength also helps him fight through screens and recover quickly defensively … He has quick hands and good instincts and can really be a problem for opposing ball handlers when pressured (2.2 steals per 40 minutes) … Smith is a score first point guard with the ability to put pressure on the defense via isolation or the pick and roll … He is quite difficult to stay in front of due to his shiftiness and ability to drive with either hand … He is also improving as a shooter, particularly from long range where he shot a respectable 35.9% this season … Where Smith truly shines on the offensive end, however, is his ability to create his own offense … He can fill it up from all three levels, which will bode well for him in a modern NBA with an abundance of scoring point guards … He does a good job of reading his defender off the pick and roll and has the ability to rise into a pull up jumper, where he gets great elevation … He also frequently utilizes a lethal step back jumper when the guard is able to recover off the screen … He improved as a 3 point shooter as his freshman season progressed … Smith is a tough shot maker with the ability to bail his team out late in the shot clock … He has the ability to make a play on the offensive end every time he touches the ball in one way or another … Especially when his jumper is falling, there is almost no way to guard him because his so dangerous off the dribble and getting to the basket … He is exceptional at creating space with jab steps, a variety of dribble moves, and a quick rising pull up jumper … He is best when on the ball but is a capable spot up shooter when left open … He has an innate ability to attack closeouts hard to pull up off the dribble or finish at the rim … Smith primarily is looking to score, but he is a capable playmaker as well (6.8 assists per 40 minutes) … He wasn’t in an ideal situation at N.C. State, but he is capable of creating space, surveying the floor and passing the ball with either hand out of pick and roll situations … With better talent around him in the NBA, he will look like an even better playmaker … His open court speed makes him particularly dangerous in transition, as he will collapse the defense and find cutters or open shooters on the perimeter … He does not need a screen to collapse the defense … Instead he can usually break his man down off the dribble and get in the paint to kick out to open teammates … He also shows flashes of impressive vision and accuracy off the pick and roll … He will have a chance to be an absolute force on both ends of the court in the NBA … Has excellent size at the point guard position at 6’2 with a 6’5 wingspan … Shows a lot of confidence in his abilities and has a swagger on the floor, should not have any trouble adjusting to playing at the NBA level and be a standout PG at the next level … His upside is among the best of any player in this draft …","Questions about attitude, focus and desire have surrounded Smith since his high school days … Has a tendency to rely on his physical gifts and not pay enough attention to detail in regards to improving as a PG … As talented as Smith is, he is still learning how to play the position and run a team offense at an optimum level … He can improve his feel for when to create his own offense or when to facilitate … He did not always seem to be on the same page with his teammates, which could be interpreted as a lack of leadership … His overall decision-making, particularly off the pick and roll still need to improve, and he needs to become more vocal to be a quality leader in the NBA … He can be a bit turnover prone, as he has a tendency to make careless entry passes and pick up his dribble against pressure without knowing where he wants to go with the ball … He does not always initiate the offense with consistency and can learn to be more unselfish … Often times he will launch a contested shot without any prior passes or turn it over before any set is run … Smith also will settle for long jumpers early in the shot clock or force contested pull up jumpers instead of getting all the way to the rim or making a play for someone else … In transition he is dangerous, but he does not always look ahead for open teammates and will instead force a low percentage shot … He does the same off the pick and roll where he will frequently miss wide open teammates when double teamed off the screen … Smith struggled with consistency this past season in terms of effort and overall impact … Fell asleep defensively far too often showing a lack of commitment and focus … Despite the fact that he has great upside defensively, his intensity has to improve … Smith did not have a great situation at NC State, but a player as talented as him should be able to carry them to a more successful season … Too often he proved to be lazy fighting through screens and closing out on shooters … He can be too upright and often appears uninterested in keeping his man in front of him … As a shooter, he still has room to improve, as he is best with some upward momentum … He releases the ball on the way down sometimes and has an occasional hitch at the top of his release, which leads to sporadic results …",74,195,19.59

DJ Wilson,17,"Wilson was a late bloomer this season for Michigan, and he particularly broke out in the NCAA Tournament demonstrating numerous abilities that offer intriguing under the radar NBA potential … He was a key player in turning Michigan’s season around on their way to the Big Ten tournament title and a trip all the way to the Sweet 16 in March, after an up and down regular season … After averaging just 11 points per game in the regular season, he exploded in the tournament, averaging 18.5 points per contest and 3.5 blocks in three games, showing his ability to perform in big moments … At 6’10” and 240 pounds, he is quite a fluid mover and runs the floor very well in transition with long strides … He is also a good cutter without the ball, allowing him to get loose and get easy baskets at the rim … Wilson has good length with a 7’3” wingspan and can finish above the rim in space when receiving passes off of cuts or in transition … Wilson also demonstrates some good perimeter skills for his size, offering potential as a stretch four man in the NBA, which is essential nowadays for modern NBA big men … He has shown to be a dangerous pick and pop threat (37% 3s) and has good mechanics with a quick release and high release point … The defense has to respect his ability to catch and shoot, and he does a good job of attacking closeouts with his footwork and solid ball handling ability to counter when the defense prevents him from catching and shooting … Wilson is a good straight-line driver with both hands, but he likes to drive to his left so he can get to his floater with his right hand … He has good touch on his floater and is able to get his shot off over a lot of defenders with his size and length … Wilson has also shown a respectable face up post game and has an excellent face up jumper off of his inside pivot … He also has excellent footwork in the post and the ability to make jump hooks with either hand … On the defensive end, Wilson is rangy on the perimeter with the ability to keep smaller players in front off the dribble while still being able to contest jumpers with his length. He also has good closing speed on the perimeter and can chase guards off the perimeter due to his fluidity … He also has good lateral quickness and can switch/hedge out on ball screens and still recover … He also offers upside as a rim protector with his length and solid timing once he can refine his defensive awareness … He can also use his length to get in passing lanes and force turnovers off the ball.","Wilson has some outstanding physical tools, but he still needs to learn how to maximize them with consistency … Often times instead of getting all the way to the rim and finishing with his length, he will settle for contested jumpers even when switched on a smaller player … He has a tendency to float on the perimeter when matched up with smaller players instead of posting up and using his size … He has great skill, but he will settle for a lot of contested jumpers early on in the shot clock … Wilson does not have great vision and can improve as a passer out of the post … He has a good handle for his size but will try to do too much at times and over dribble instead of relying on primary ball handlers, which leads to avoidable turnovers … Wilson needs to improve his physicality and toughness in the post, as he does not work hard to get good position against players his size … He also is not a great finisher in traffic and does not get to the free throw line that often (2.3 FTA per 40). He is skilled but he shies away from contact and mostly relies on finesse rather than physicality. He has great upside on the defensive end, but he needs to improve his awareness before he reaches that level … He can be late to hedge out on ball screens and often gets beat off the ball on cuts … He can do a better job of staying low and being in a good stance to maximize his explosiveness … He also does not always see the ball well, which makes him late to come over to the ball side and help out when needed, and he does not always jump to the ball from the weak side … The biggest thing he could improve upon, however, is his production on the glass … In 30 minutes of action last season, he averaged only 5.3 rebounds per game … With his combination of size, length, and athleticism, that number should be much higher … Improving his toughness and learning how to get good position down low will allow him to be much more of a factor here …",82,235,21.35
TJ Leaf,18,"A versatile offensive player who shows the ability to play both inside and out … He has a European-like skillset and does a great job of exploiting mismatches on offense … Although he is not an advanced post player at this stage in his career, he has shown flashes of good footwork and a variety of post moves from the block … He has nice touch around the basket and effectively utilizes jump hooks, turnaround jumpers, and even an occasional dream shake … As a shooter, Leaf has good mechanics and is more than capable stretching the floor as a three-point shooter … He also demonstrates a solid mid-range pull up game, particularly from the elbows … He excels at taking bigger defenders off the dribble and does a great job of utilizing ball fakes from the perimeter … Leaf is not an elite athlete, but he is a good jumper off two feet and can finish above the rim consistently … Even though he isn’t the quickest laterally, he does a good job of moving his feet and using his size to stay in front of quicker guards … He also has solid defensive instincts and is a capable shot blocker … Two of Leaf’s strongest attributes are his high basketball I.Q. and his motor … He has also proven to be a clutch player who doesn’t get phased by a big moment or crowd (Rupp Arena) … Leaf moves well without the ball allowing him to get high quality shots … He’s also an excellent and willing passer for his size … Rarely does he force the issue, and he is almost always under control … He plays with consistent effort and regularly makes hustle plays, particularly on the offensive glass … Leaf is a terrific rebounder, which has a lot to do with how relentlessly he pursues the ball on both ends of the court … Leaf’s size, versatility, feel for the game, and motor make him a prospect with a high floor …","The biggest area of concern for Leaf at this point is his lack of strength … He needs to add leg and core strength to better absorb contact and maintain balance … The good news is that he is only 19 years old and that there’s plenty of time for his frame to fill out … However, this hurts his ability to defend in the post where he can sometimes get pushed around … Although he is a capable finisher at the rim, he also struggles to finish through contact and does not have great body control when attacking the basket … As skilled as he is, rarely does he finish around the basket with his left hand … Leaf will need to improve in this area at the next level, or it will be much more difficult for him to score consistently … Right now he projects as more of a stretch four than a reliable go to option on the block … Leaf also doesn’t have great length and doesn’t really project as a rim protector at the next level … Although he has good instincts, he struggles defensively at times with longer and more athletic forwards …",82,225,20.16

Harry Giles,20,"Giles is an extremely gifted athlete, arguably the best big man prospect in this entire draft when healthy, something he hasn’t been in quite a while … Looks the part of an NBA big man with his frame … An explosive leaper even with the injuries to his knees …  He’s got great hands which allows him to finish around the rim and in traffic …  He runs the floor well for a big man and is active on the glass … Shows a lot of physicality in the post and doesn’t shy away from contact on defense … Takes contact in the chest, isn’t easily moved off of his spots and is an above average rim protector … Moves his feet extremely well and has really good lateral quickness for a big man … Can play both the PF and C positions in the NBA from a defensive standpoint and while he is a work in progress on the offensive end, he has exhibited an ability to use a variety of post moves to score in the paint … Before his injury, he excelled in a face up game from about 15 feet and used his superior quickness, length and athleticism to get to the rim and finish with a purpose … The consensus top overall player in his class for years while in high , Giles has everything an NBA scout/GM could want from a prospect physically … A tremendous kid with a extremely outgoing and likable personality …","Multiple knee surgeries including two ACL tears (both knees) and an MCL tear (left) before graduating high school is a huge question mark with regards to the outlook of Giles’ career.  No team wants to draft the next Greg Oden and players with injury histories like that of Giles always raise red flags to scouts and GM’s who are putting their jobs on the line with every draft pick and free agent signing …  His ability to explode with contact seemed affected … As far as Giles’ looks on the court, he seemed to get lost at times during his freshman season and was almost afraid to do certain things … Whether that was simply due to a fear of another injury, lack of conditioning, Duke’s struggles in developing bigs, or an awareness thing remains to be seen … He isn’t a versatile player on offense and doesn’t really possess the range that you would like to see out of a PF even though that was always was he projected to be during his days in high school …  Doesn’t have great footwork or great touch on offense and relies heavily on put backs and dunks for most of his points …  His jumper is one glaring hole in his game as he routinely air balled or barely drew iron once outside of about 12 feet …  Doesn’t make great decisions on offense and hasn’t really learned to simply play within himself just yet …",82,230,19.18
Terrance Ferguson,21,"Ferguson has been somewhat forgotten over the past year as a result of his decision to forgo a season of college basketball and continue his career overseas for the Adelaide 36ers in Australia … However, Ferguson has been an electrifying player since his high school days where he finished as a top-20 national recruit and was selected for several prestigious high school all-star games including the McDonald’s All-American Game and the Nike Hoop Summit (where he went on a 3 point shooting barrage) … Ferguson’s combination of size and explosiveness immediately stand out and highlight his potential as an impactful NBA player … While he does not have elite length (6-9 wingspan), he has nice size for an NBA wing player at 6-7 … He also moves up and down the court with excellent fluidity with long strides and a quick, explosive first step … Where Ferguson particularly stands out, however, is his tremendous leaping ability in space, particularly off of one foot … He posted a 38” max vertical at the NBA Combine, and it is also worth noting that he won the Ballislife All-American Dunk Contest back in April 2015, after performing a free-throw line dunk … He has great straight line burst, which allows him to build momentum on his way to the basket and finish above the rim with ease … Ferguson’s athleticism comes into play in half court offense as well … Although, he is not a great shot creator, he gets great elevation on his mid range jumper and is able to shoot over the top of most defenders … He employs this ability frequently when working out of the post where he can face the basket and rise up for a routine jumper … This also gives him plenty of upside as a rebounder, and while he still has work to do to become a reliable factor on the glass, he has good motor and the necessary explosiveness to eventually be a consistent contributor in this area … He will especially be more effective on the boards as his frame fills out and he continues to get stronger, but he does a terrific job of compensating for his current lack of strength by almost always finding a man to box out when the shot goes up … Ferguson is also an excellent spot up shooter with potential for even further improvement with more repetition … He shot a very respectable 38.7% from distance this past season overseas, and he has great footwork before the catch with great elevation and a quick release … His shoulders are consistently squared to the basket, and he is almost always on balance when coming off  screens … His ability to get his feet under him and step into his shot with confidence before rising is picturesque … Ferguson also has decent upside as a defender thanks to his lateral quickness and competitiveness … He has terrific feet, can cover a lot of ground, and does well to stay in front of smaller players … While he lacks the requisite strength to be an interior defensive presence, he competes for position down low and does not back down against bigger players … He shows good skill in defending isolation on the perimeter, as he has good hip fluidity, and he works hard to force difficult shots … He also demonstrates great effort chasing shooters off of the three-point line, and he will press full court occasionally … There is still plenty of room for Ferguson to grow as well … Offensively, he shows flashes of playmaking ability and has some potential as a pull-up shooter too … On defense, once he improves his instincts he could become a real asset on that end of the floor as he already does a great job of flying around the ball and being active …","One of the biggest concerns right now for Ferguson, as mentioned earlier, is his lack of an ideal frame … He checked in at the Combine at just 184 pounds, which causes him to struggle containing bigger guards … He also can get pushed out of position pretty easily and get caught on screens … This also causes him to get pushed out of his spots on offense, as he often is not able to get all the way to the rim without an open lane … Against bigger guards and wings, he allows his man to go right through him most times without showing much resistance … He also can be too upright, which somewhat mitigates his lateral quickness and athleticism … Even though he is competitive with big men down low on switches, he is too thin to be a true threat when defending them … On offense he is easily knocked off balance when going to the basket, and he shies away from contact, limiting his size advantage … Ferguson also rarely gets to the free-throw line (2.2 FTA per 40 minutes), and he still needs to refine his in between game to become a better all-around offensive threat … His ball handling skills are very limited, and he struggles to create space, especially against better defenders … Right now he is limited to mostly catch and shoot offense and straight line drives … He also has much room for improvement as a passer and initiating offense, as he turns the ball over much more frequently than he registers assists … As common for a young player, his feel for the game and instincts on both ends are just average … He averaged just 0.4 steals and 0.7 blocks per 40 minutes, which are numbers that should probably be much higher given his tools … He tends to get lost off the ball on defense, and tends to force a lot of passes as well instead of making the simple play … As a shooter Ferguson must become more consistent … This will probably determine if he becomes a solid contributor in the NBA … With his other limitations, he must be able to knock down perimeter shots consistently … He sometimes shoots on the way down, despite his excellent elevation on his jump shot, and he is a relatively poor free throw shooter (58.3%) …",79,185,19.11
Jarrett Allen,22,"When looking towards the next level, Jarrett Allen’s size and length are some of the first things you notice when he’s on the court. Standing 6’10.5’’ in shoes, possessing an elite 7’5.5’’ wingspan, and a 9’2.5’’ standing reach, Allen’s ability to haul in rebounds will be one of his calling cards in the NBA … Through 22 games into his college career, Allen is pulling in a very respectable 8.4 rebounds per game, which includes a 2.9 split for offensive boards … His length, really allows him to get well above the rim with minimal effort … He’s also turned up his productivity during conference play, as he adjusts further to the NCAA game … Through 8 Big 12 games, Jarrett is pulling down 11 rebounds per game, which also included 3 straight double doubles in early Jan. Allen’s length will also allow him to protect the rim at the next level … He’s not an elite shot blocker, although good (1.6 bpg), but as he adds weight and experience, he has the ability to become a deterrent in the paint in the NBA … His immense length makes up for some deficiencies moving laterally, and he’s shown the ability to hedge successfully while defending pick and roll situations … Due to Shaquille Cleare playing the center for the Longhorns, Allen has actually played this season at the 4 spot for Shaka Smart … Allen’s ability to shoot in the mid range allows this, and it’s a nice piece of his offensive game when looking towards the NBA … Jarrett has a nice touch out to 12 feet, and good hands that allow him to catch passes around the rim, and finish at a good clip (68% at the rim according to hoop-math.com) … This foundation at such a young age make it reasonable to project him as being a player in the pick and pop game, as well as a solid roll man … His FT percentage is just 60%, but again, as he’s gained confidence throughout the season, he’s seen this element of his game improve. During Big 12 play, Allen is shooting 75% on a pretty decent 4.5 attempts per game. I wouldn’t go as far to say Jarrett projects as a high level offensive talent in the NBA, but his shooting touch gives him far more potential than many bigs his size who rely on athleticism alone to get buckets … Allen is a pretty good athlete as well … He’s a fast player for being near 7 feet tall, and is already 235 pounds. He appears to have the frame to add muscle, which he will need to do going forward.","Jarrett Allen has good end to end speed, but he’s not particularly quick laterally, and possesses a bit of an awkward gate, as he hunches over when he runs … This is not particularly a huge issue, as I feel it could be corrected and improved as he gains strength and improves his conditioning … Allen still brings the ball down too much in the lane, which can lead to being stripped, and when he executes offense in the post it is often very slow and robotic … He’s very much a work in progress on offense, and despite his size and length advantage at the NCAA level, the game still appears to be pretty fast for him, and he doesn’t handle double teams well, nor instances in which he is heavily pressured … He is a solid passer in terms of knowing where to put the ball, but he often turns the ball over when defenders dial it up a notch … He’s also not the greatest in terms of boxing out, he’s good at picking the right spot, but is often muscled out by stronger players …",82,235,19.19
OG Anunoby,23,"Excellent wingspan (7’2.5”) for his size … Possesses the body control to get to and finish at the rim … Very capable of making an impact off of straight-line drives … Has an NBA-ready frame … Surprising lateral speed for a player with as much muscle mass as he shows … Defensive potential is his calling card … Already shows the signs of being a high-level defender … Can guard multiple positions on the court … Length could allow him to develop into a small-ball big in the future … Light on his feet on the perimeter … Disruptive defender, jumps passing lanes whenever he sees the opportunity … Was an interior presence defensively, especially as the weak side defender … Able to stay on the floor and block shots as a perimeter defender due to excellent reach … Possesses nice defensive instincts … Closes out well and under control on shooters … Flashed solid footwork understanding on the offensive end … Will make open or uncontested threes … Shot has a nice rotation and backspin on it, hits the rim softly … Sees and makes the extra pass … Monster on the offensive boards … Can keep possessions alive with rebounds and will convert second-chance opportunities into baskets …Very good cutter off the ball … Good at cutting back door. Looks for defender to turn head and then makes his baseline move to the lane … Ally oop threat, likely to make plenty of highlight plays on lob passes … His offensive numbers are misleading as he actually has very good potential as a shooter, if he can hone his ability in using deception to create looks …","No real defined role offensively yet … A little bit stiff in his movements and running the floor … Thick legs … Doesn’t always exhibit an ideal level of intensity … Needs to work on his ability to create shots … Shot mechanics need some fine tuning as he has a bit of a slow release and seems to telegraph his shot too often … His motion gets sped up if a defender is too close to him … Shoots with minimal arc and not much rotation … Only shot 52 percent from the free throw line … Is not a strong ball handler, dribbles high and away from body … Can be very loose with the ball, especially with his off hand … Does not create his own offense … Won’t be an instant facilitator at the next level … Has trouble recognizing the open player as a playmaker … His effort was very up-and-down during his stint at Indiana … While he has the tools to become a quality defender, was slow at times reacting on defense … Late-bloomer so his basketball IQ needs some catching up …  Post skills are extremely raw and in need of refinement … While he shows solid attributes and potential as a rebounder, remains extremely unproven having averaged 2.6 and 5.4 rebounds per game over his FR and SO seasons … Is recovering from a torn ACL suffered in late January, which could cloud his draft stock …",79,235,19.95

Derrick White,29,"White has good size for a lead guard at 6’5” with a 6’8” wingspan and is comfortable playing either guard spot. His size allows him to see over the top of most defenders where he can utilize his passing ability and be a primary facilitator in an offense … White always plays with his head up in transition and is able to recognize passing lanes by seeing over the top of the defense with his size … He is willing passer that plays with good patience, and he does a good job of finding big men ducking in from the post area or kicking out to shooters off the drive or from the perimeter … His size, combined with good elevation also allows him to pull up in the mid range area over longer defenders … Although he is not a great athlete, his combination of size and length allows him to finish above the rim in space with ease … As a defender he is disruptive with his length, does a good job of getting in passing lanes to force turnovers, and contest shots … White’s greatest strength is most likely his versatility as a scorer … In his lone season for Colorado he averaged 22.3 points per 40 minutes on 57% shooting from two point range and 40% shooting from three, showing the ability to fill it up from all three levels … He has excellent instincts and plays with great pace and skill … White excels at scoring out of the pick and roll, where he can pull up off the dribble or finish with craftiness at the rim … He has a particularly advanced floater game, which he can use off of one foot or two feet with soft touch … White can finish with either hand and has excellent body control when going to the rim … He is also a quite capable spot up shooter, which allows him to be effective off the ball, and he can fire away coming off of screens … He does an exemplary job of getting his feet under him, having good balance, and exhibiting a quick release … White also gets to the free throw line frequently, where he converts at an excellent 81% … He does a great job of reading the defense off of the pick and roll, where he can turn the corner if the defense goes over the screen or make the defense pay with his jumper for going under … He gets great elevation on his mid range pull up jumper with crisp footwork before the shot … He also takes advantage of switches in the pick and roll by frequently using hesitation dribbles and changing direction to keep the bigger defender off balance … White attacks closeouts very well with jab steps, shot fakes, and step backs to separate into his pull up jumper … Another strong selling point of his repertoire is his advanced feel for the game on both ends of the court … He consistently stays poised under pressure and has the requisite vision to initiate the offense … He also has solid defensive instincts, anticipating plays well and forcing ball handlers to make counter moves … Out of the pick and roll, he uses the entire width of the floor and has excellent timing with his passes … He also can hit both the roll man and shooters on the perimeter from various passing angles … What really stands out in this area is the fact that he keeps his dribble alive and stays clam when the defense hedges hard on the ball screen, allowing him to continue the offensive flow … He also has good awareness defensively when locked in and understands where to be on the court at all times … His best attribute defensively is his ability to slide his feet and stay in front of a ball handler without using his hands … He does a textbook job of preventing straight line drives and forcing his man to change directions … Many scouts also believe that because White is a late bloomer, there is still plenty of room for him to continue developing … He is a Division-2 transfer from University of Colorado – Colorado Springs, and his frame may not be entirely filled out yet …","White may still have some untapped athletic potential, but at this stage he does not have great burst or shiftiness, which may limit his ability to get to the rim or stay in front of quicker guards at the NBA level … He can be too upright at times both when turning the corner on offense and when guarding his man, limiting his explosiveness … He also may struggle to get all the way to the rim and finish over the top of NBA length … He has only an average first step from a triple threat position, making it challenging for him to turn the corner easily … His lack of burst also does not allow him to play slow to fast at a high level, as he is unable to change gears with much force … Even against big men in the pick and roll, he is not always able to turn the corner and is often forced to settle for off balance jumpers … Against teams above .500, he shot 50% from two-point range compared to over 60% against teams under .500, leaving numerous questions about if he can create offense against better competition … Despite solid athleticism combine numbers, (36.5 max vert) he is generally a below the rim player in traffic, and he will have to rely on floaters mostly, but he has shown great ability in this area … White also has an easygoing demeanor on the court and can get a bit casual at times … He needs to be a bit more vocal, especially if he is going to play a lead guard role in the NBA … He also needs to cut down on the careless turnovers and play with more consistent urgency on defense … He has a tendency to telegraph simple passes, leading to several avoidable turnovers … He also will settle for too many difficult, contested pull-ups on offense at times … On defense he will take plays off; instead of getting low in his stance and being committed to stopping his man by sliding his feet he will reach a bit too often … His defensive versatility in the NBA is also a big question mark … On the one hand, he may not have the frame to guard bigger two guards and wings, but he also may not be quick enough to guard

At 6’4’’ and  (6’8.5’’ wingspan) barefoot he’ll measure up pretty well for an NBA shooting guard, he’s a well built 205-215 pounds (204 at last year’s combine) and will be able to keep up with more guards than one’s he’s outmatched against … Hart is a competitor, and was an elite defensive guard in college … Averaged 1.6 steals per game in route to a share of the Big East’s Defensive Player of the Year award … Josh also tested pretty well as an athlete last year at the combine … A 38.5’’ max vertical was one of his more impressive stats, but he doesn’t quite fit the bill as an elite overall athlete …  He fits the prototype of a 3 and D role player in the NBA, who also increased his effectiveness as a distributor at Villanova.

Lack of great lateral speed limits his ability to stand out in this area … Jack of all trades, master of none type. He has rounded out his weak spots fairly well, but still doesn’t have any skill that will stand out at the next level … Hart has improved as an overall shooter, but he’s still not great operating in the mid range … As a two guard, he’s also not a high level ball handler at this point in his development … While solid, he’s not going to provide as much versatility as some in a league with increasingly interchangeable backcourts …",77,210,22.31

Mason’s drive and kick game is one of his strongest areas of being a set up man … His ability as a scorer is well rounded … He’s averaged 20.9 points per game, and he can get them at the rim, in the mid range, in transition, and beyond the arc … Mason is a bulldog and can use his high level athletic ability to get tough buckets, and get to the line, where he shoots .784% … Speaking of his athletic ability, he has elite quickness, and end to end speed, both with and without the ball in his hands … KU trainer Andrea Hudy has regarded him as the strongest player on the team, and this greatly aids him on the court … His body control and leaping ability are also very impressive … Despite being under 6’, Frank has converted alley-oop dunks and countless plays that require high levels of athleticism … Mason is a tough defender, who is great at getting under larger guards … His lateral quickness makes him tough to get past, and his effort is always there … It’d be easy for a player with his offensive burden to dial it back on D, but Frank’s toughness and leadership qualities shine through where he gives maximum effort at all times …","Undersized at the point guard position, Frank Mason III is just 5’11’’ tall, and looks to have a wingspan just slightly longer than his height … He can do plenty of things to make up for this, but this will directly affect how he finishes around the rim in the NBA … Mason converted at about a 56% clip (hoop-math.com) at the NCAA level, but despite his body control, he’ll find it more difficult to convert at the next level … Frank can also get caught in the air without a plan … He’s much better than he was when he first hit the NCAA scene, but he still can be a tad reckless at times … He will also be easy to shoot over in the NBA … While pesky, and tough, his defensive outlook will still be affected by his stature … There’s little doubt Frank will continue to improve as a player, but at nearly 23 years old, you wonder how much upside he has left.",72,190,23.24

Rabb is also a big target in the post with his long arms and great hands. He is a bit streaky but definitely capable in the mid-range game, as he utilizes both jab steps and step backs to create separation into his shot. He is crafty in the post with his footwork and is particularly light on his feet when under duress down low … Also has an underrated basketball IQ, and has good feel for recognizing double teams and knowing when to pass out of them … He also has a good understanding of defensive positioning and handled the often-difficult moments at Cal quite maturely … He has good recognition off the ball on defense and does a good job of not fouling when coming over to help from the weak side … His above average ability to close out and defend bigs on the perimeter will help him in today’s NBA …","Rabb is more of an old school post player and does not have ideal perimeter skills that NBA teams look for in a modern NBA big man … He does not space the floor with great consistency and shoots a flat ball at times … He will need to become more of a threat off the pick and pop to be a truly reliable offensive weapon in the league, and he must continue to improve as a free throw shooter (66%) … He also does not have the ball skills to create for himself on the perimeter, and most of his scoring will come in the post … He is much better as a straight-line driver, but when the defense takes this away, he is not fluid or skilled enough to utilize a counter move and create offense for himself effectively … He also struggles to attack closeouts off the pick and pop, which really limits him offensively … Lacks the strength to finish against NBA caliber big men with better length and athleticism … His skillset projects towards him being more of a center in the NBA, but he may not have the size and strength to be effective there … He can be knocked out of position pretty easily and does not have good body control against contact … This sort of tweener identity limits his defensive potential as well, as he is a tad small for the five and not quite rangy enough for the four … He is limited as a rim protector with only 1.3 blocks per 40 minutes, and could be a liability in the pick and roll when needed to switch out against smaller players …",82,220,20.39

He doesn’t establish position in the Post and can’t really exploit any miss-matches… His Post game is just average and doesn’t have enough counter moves… At times he tries to do too much with his ball in his hands, either by forcing a difficult pass or make one more dribble than he should, which leads to turnovers… There are moments he puts his hands down when he tries to block a shot and as a result he commits bad fouls… Holds his ground in the post on Defense, but he can’t really contain strong, physical players… Can lose focus on defense, and be too concern looking at the ball…",82,235,21.48

Jawun Evans,39,"After a promising freshman season cut short by injury, Jawun Evans came back and further established himself as both a dynamic scorer and distributor in the college ranks … Evans really has a good understanding of operating in the pick and roll, as well as artfully using screens to get a good shot … His ability to run an offense, understand spacing, and create for others will directly translate to the pro game … Jawun is also a strong shooter who hit 38% from deep during his sophomore campaign … His 81% clip from the free throw line, as well as a 48% percentage as a freshman paired with good mechanics and on court smarts would lead me to believe he will continue to improve from beyond the arc … His 19.2 points per contest were achieved on a variety of shots as well … Evans can get to the hoop, operate in the mid-range, and get out in transition. He also has a nice array of floaters and is good at creating space between defenders in order to get attempts up over shot blockers … While not an elite athlete, he is extremely quick and has pretty good lift … A glass half full observation would mention his 6’4’’ wingspan, which is helpful considering his small stature … Evans 6.4 assists per game lead the Big 12 this past season, and he did so with a pretty solid 2.28 assist to turnover ratio … Quick hands, and good anticipation also allowed him to rack up 1.8 steals per game as a sophomore … Evans has showcased the ability to take over games … He went for 25 or more points 8 times this past season did so without sacrificing his distribution duties … Jawun can be streaky as well. When he’s rolling he proved to often be too much to handle at the college ranks, and he does enough outside of scoring he’s still a valuable asset when his shot isn’t falling …","Defensively Evans will have trouble at the next level … While 5’11.5’’ in shoes he does sport a nice wingspan, but he’s not overly strong for his size, nor is he an elite athlete … His effort is a plus, though, but he’ll be easy to shoot over in the NBA … Like many smaller guards, he also projects to struggle in the lane … According to hoop-math.com he shot just 50.4% at the rim against big men that will be much smaller and less athletic than their NBA counterparts … He didn’t enjoy the most efficient sophomore season … It should be noted that he carried a massive offensive load for the Cowboys, but 43% shooting in the NCAA isn’t a good clip, and things don’t get any easier in the NBA … A better shooting freshman season would give hope to turning things around when he’s not expected to shoot 15 times and be the primary ball handler and distributor, but he’ll also be playing against tougher competition …",72,185,20.92

Tyler Dorsey,41,"Dorsey ended his Oregon career on fire, leading the somewhat depleted Ducks all the way to the Final Four … He finished the year with eight straight 20-plus point games, while earning the nickname “Mr. March” for his stellar play in big games … He continued his momentum into the NBA Combine, where he posted per 40 averages of 21.6 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists on 56% shooting from three-point range in two games … Dorsey’s play over the last few months has vaulted him into an intriguing possible second round option for any team looking to add shooting off the bench … Dorsey’s elevated draft stock begins with his outstanding scoring instincts … He shot an excellent 41% from distance in his two seasons with the Ducks and is also an excellent shooter off the dribble … While he is not an explosive athlete, he makes up for it around the rim with soft touch and craft to convert a high percentage (57.3% at the rim) of his looks inside. He does an excellent job of spotting up in transition as he has a knack for finding open spaces on the court to get his shot off, where he has deep range that should translate to the NBA arc … He gets his feet set quickly as well, and his mechanics stay consistent with a hand in his face … Dorsey also does a great job of running off screens to get his shot off and looks very comfortable shooting on the move … Off the pick and roll he consistently demonstrated the ability to make defenders pay for going under the ball screen with his pull up jumper … One also has to appreciate that he never loses confidence in his shot and that he does not need much space at all to get it off … At the rim, he uses a lot of shot fakes and has excellent footwork to get his shot off, or draw contact and get to the free throw line (75% conversion rate) … It is primarily Dorsey’s shot making and ability to get hot in a hurry that gives him great potential as a role player in the NBA … With NBA spacing he could thrive as a shot maker and secondary ball handler off the bench. Dorsey is not a true floor general, but he did play a lot of point guard for Oregon, so he has experience running an offense … He is also improving as a playmaker, as he has decent vision and does not turn the ball over that frequently … He operates well out of the pick and roll and has shown flashes of making good reads to set up his teammates … Dorsey particularly showed during the NCAA Tournament that he is unusually poised in big moments and that he can be depended on to make big plays when it counts … Any potential playoff team that may draft him would really appreciate the mental aspect of his game … If Dorsey can prove that the NCAA Tournament was not a fluke and that he is really beginning to put it all together, he could carve out a nice career for himself.","The most concerning aspect of Dorsey’s game is his less than impressive physical tools for an NBA two-guard … He checked in at the NBA Combine at 6-4.5 with an even more underwhelming 6-5 wingspan … He also weighs just 183 pounds, so he may struggle to get to the rim and finish against bigger, physical guards … This will likely prevent him from being a multi-positional defender at the next level … His lack of length will limit his effectiveness to guard on the perimeter and be active in passing lanes … He has already shown limitations in this area, averaging just 1.1 steals per 40 minutes in two seasons at Oregon … With his physical profile, he is probably best suited to guard point guards, but he may not be quick enough to do so given how explosive modern-day NBA point guards are … Dorsey also does not show a great deal of competitiveness on this end of the court either … When switched onto bigger players he does not battle for position persistently … He also tends to have some frequent lapses off the ball, losing shooters on the wings or giving up easy backdoor cuts. Dorsey does not project as an advanced shot creator at the NBA level either. Given his average explosiveness and shiftiness with the ball, he can get forced into some difficult shots, and he will probably have trouble finishing around the rim against NBA length/athleticism. Much of his shot selection comes via difficult contested shots given his lack of creativity with the ball and his less than ideal physical tools. He can be out of control going to the rim as well and force a lot of wild shots at the basket instead of looking to make a play for someone else. Dorsey is not a very willing passer either, which can cause him to be inefficient at times. It appears that the majority of his NBA impact will be contingent on his shot making ability. However, if he can’t get hot from the outside, NBA teams might worry if there is anything else he can bring to the table.",76,185,21.37

His ambidexterity around the basket also makes him a lot more dangerous as a scorer around the rim and really completes his offensive repertoire … Brooks also shows flashes of terrific vision (4.3 assists per 40 minutes) whether kicking out to open shooter or to big men ducking in the low post … In addition, it is difficult to ignore the advanced mental aspects of Brooks’ game … He never seems to lose confidence and clearly is not afraid of the big moment … Brooks hit multiple game-winning shots this year and was a key piece in Oregon’s Final Four run that included an upset-win over top-seeded Kansas in the Elite Eight …","The biggest question at this stage with Brooks is how much his less than stellar length (6-6 wingspan) will hold him back in the NBA … Even though he has the strength to finish through contact, his lack of length impedes his ability to finish over defenders with NBA-level physical profiles … It is also uncertain whom he will be able to guard at the next level with his lack of elite length or quickness, which causes him to struggle containing quicker guards off the dribble … He was most effective guarding fours in college, but they will be much bigger and longer in the NBA … He may not be able to create offense effectively against NBA wings either, as he benefited in college from playing a lot of small-ball four … A good portion of his offense came via straight line drives, but he will not be able replicate this in the pros, and he does not have much shiftiness with the ball as a counter … When his straight line drive is taken away he does not have much change of direction skill … He does not change speed with the ball well and is really not the most advanced ball handler either … He also lacks burst from a stand still position, preventing him from turning the corner at times … He probably will not be able to rely on isolation scoring in the NBA, but much of his offense came from these types of plays … How will he fit into an NBA offense without disrupting its flow? Brooks also averaged 3.3 turnovers per 40 minutes, which is a higher number than what one would like to see from a forward … He also is not an effective rebounder at just 5.1 rebounds per 40 minutes, showing some inconsistent effort on box outs and fighting for good position … Brooks will need to show that he can bring more to the table than shot making if he wants to be a reliable rotational player in the NBA …",78,220,21.43
Sterling Brown,46,"Brown was a key contributor for an outstanding SMU team this season, and he has a chance to be one of the biggest sleepers in this draft … His physical tools and offensive skill give him a shot to be taken in the second round … He averaged 13.4 points per game and shot 44.9% from three as a senior, and is a 45.1% percent shooter from distance in his career … Brown also was a factor in numerous other areas, averaging 6.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.4 steals per game … Brown is a crafty, high IQ player that plays within himself, and his overall skillset points toward a valuable three and D player, which is coveted nowadays … He is an excellent catch and shoot player with good mechanics and a quick release … He also looks comfortable as a scorer in terms of being able to create his own shot and be a playmaker for others (3.0 assists per game) … He is an adept scorer off the dribble in the mid-range area, especially off of a one-dribble pull up … There is no glaring weakness to Brown’s overall offensive skillset, which will keep him on the court at the NBA level … At 6’5” with a 6’9” wingspan, Brown has the potential to be a multi-positional defender on the perimeter … He has a solid frame at 230 pounds as well, and has a solid combination of size, strength, and lateral quickness / explosiveness for an NBA two guard … He also showed he could be disruptive on the perimeter at SMU, averaging 1.4 steals per game this past season … Brown is an exceptional rebounder for a guard as well with great motor and the athleticism necessary to chase down missed shots all over the floor … Another underrated aspect of his game to look at is that he will have a very clear role in the NBA as a secondary scorer and perimeter defender, which is quite similar to his role at SMU … This kind of continuity will make the transition to the pros much easier … Overall, he is an athletic swingman that can score in a variety of ways, and he also is a good defensive player that can guard multiple positions … ​","Brown does not have an elite first step off the dribble, which will prevent him from being as well-rounded of a scorer in the NBA as he showed in college … While he is a good all-around athlete, he is not elite in terms of explosiveness and does not project as an above the rim finisher in traffic … He converts at a high percentage from the free-throw line, but he does not get there very often … Most of Brown’s offense comes from behind the arc, and he has a tendency to settle for some tough two-point jumpers … The biggest question with him is that while he does not have any obvious weakness, he also has not mastered any particular area … He has shown himself to be an excellent shooter, but he is not a specialist … As long as his prolific shooting can carry over to the NBA, and he can become a consistently reliable perimeter defender, Brown will be just fine.",77,225,22.38
Ike Anigbogu,47,"The intrigue with Anigbogu starts with his outstanding frame, standing at 6’10"" with great length (7′ 6.25” wingspan and 9′ 2.5” standing reach) , and a strong, (252 lbs) explosive lower body … He’s also quick on his feet, changes direction well, has a quick second jump, and brings a consistently high energy level … He offers many of the qualities of the modern energy big man that NBA teams look for today … Those physical tools provide Anigbogu with a strong base, allowing him to make an impact even though his skillset is farther behind at this stage … Anigbogu contributes in a variety of ways on the offensive end, despite an unpolished perimeter game … One of his most valuable attributes is his consistent production on the offensive glass, where he pulled down an impressive 4.1 offensive rebounds per 40 minutes … Anigbogu is active on the glass and can be an explosive athlete in space … He also has the size and lower body strength to carve out space down low … He has a quick second jump, and the physicality to absorb contact, which helps him to finish second chance opportunities … Anigbogu also moves well off the ball, especially with his mobility and ability to elevate in space … His other clear strength offensively is in transition, where he has long strides and excellent speed for a big man, allowing him to beat his man down the court regularly … He’s also an active rim runner who plays with a great motor … On the defensive end appears to be where Anigbogu will make the biggest impact, and where his long-term potential is the most obvious … He averaged 3.5 blocks per 40 minutes this past season and was a quality rim protector off the bench for UCLA … His length comes into play here, as does his ability to cover ground quickly, and he shows good timing as he takes pride in finding opportunities to alter shots … Another area where Anigbogu can impact the game defensively is in the pick and roll, a key for a big man in today’s NBA … He does a good job of stepping out on ball screens to help his guard and he has the mobility to recover and cut off a driving lane or step out and contest a perimeter shot … His technique still needs to be refined, but he has the potential to switch out on guards and stay in front of them as well … Anigbogu is also a strong post defender, with the size and strength to hold his position and the length and athleticism to contest shots … The good news for Anigbogu is that the things that he does well, such as altering shots at the rim, running in transition, being a consistent threat on the offensive glass, being a lob threat at the rim, will shape an NBA role that’s become increasingly valued at his position in today’s game … His awareness and recognition needs to continue to develop, as does his overall skill level, but given his physical gifts, motor, and youth (he won’t turn 19 until October), there will be plenty of teams around the league happy to have him come draft night …","Although Anigbogu has an impressive combination of physical tools, his overall skillset has a great deal of catching up to do … His touch around the basket can be a bit erratic, as most of his scoring comes off of putbacks and lob passes … He’s also not nearly as explosive of a leaper in traffic, and he doesn’t have the awareness to consistently know when to kick the ball out and reset the possession … He will often force tough shots with little to no chance of converting … This can be seen through the fact that he shot only 48% on field goal attempts after offensive rebounds  … Even though he is an explosive athlete in space, when contested by an equal athlete, his lack of touch becomes an issue … It will be important for him to improve in this area, especially considering the jump in interior talent he’ll be facing in the NBA … He could also stand to improve his hands, as he struggles to catch passes thrown below his chest … In terms of perimeter skill level, Anigbogu still has much work to do. He attempted just eight jump shots on the season, and looked very mechanical when doing so … There isn’t a whole lot of fluidity in his jump shot, and his 53.5% shooting from the free-throw line suggests that he does not have great upside as a stretch forward … Anigbogu is similarly unrefined in the post … Despite his size and strength, he shot just 30.4% on post-up opportunities, despite using a sizable portion of his half-court offense on the block … His lack of touch again comes into play here, but his unrefined footwork is a big factor in his ineffectiveness as well … Anigbogu can become predictable in the post, as he is limited to mostly simple jump hooks and turnarounds … His hands are not secure and he fumbles away far too many easy catches and rebounds … He also becomes very turnover prone when doubled in the post, turning the ball over on nearly 18% of his post-up possessions, which is nearly as often as the 25% at which he scores … Another issue he has is that he can be too aggressive in seeking out opportunities to block shots … Anigbogu has a tendency to find himself out of position as he chases shots he has little to no chance of getting to … While his constant motor and activity level are things to be valued, he’ll have to work on harnessing his aggression and continue to develop his overall recognition, awareness, and communication defensively in order to make the most of his physical gifts … His 7.6 fouls for per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, say a lot about his lack of defensive discipline … Even though it takes six fouls in the NBA before disqualification, he will need to improve in this area to stay on the court for longer stretches … One more area he could improve on is on the defensive glass, as he hauled in just 19.9% of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court … His activity as a shot blocker hinders him somewhat in this regard, but his overall awareness can get better … He is capable of rebounding out of his area because of his physical tools, but he needs to do a better job of being in position to haul in defensive rebounds …",82,250,18.68

Improved his outside shooting and is not afraid to take deep shots under the pressure … Defensively does a good job at being active and staying in the passing lines/can pressure the ball on both G positions in defense … Handles the ball well and doesn’t turn it over (1.6 TO) … Rebounds the ball well for his size and does a great job at following missed shots; scores numerous times on put-backs dunks and easy layups under the rim when no one is expecting … Hard worker on the court and great kid off the floor.,Jaramaz has to improve his outside shooting in order to be more effective player at the next level (this season he is shooting only 28.4% for 3) … Must become a better decision maker on P&R situations … His jump shot has low point of release and has to learn how to shoots it higher among other things in that area; in my opinion he has to change his shooting form in order to increase his outside percentage … Defensively he is trying to go for too much at the times … His age works against him some as he’s already draft eligible and older than other options at the PG position …,76,195,21.82

Cam Oliver,-1,"An extremely explosive athlete who unleashes ferocious dunks on the rim … Oliver plays with ferocity, intensity and aggressiveness … He is a terrific rim protector, having EIGHT games this season with four or more blocks … He gets after it under the boards too, having 11 double-doubles in points and rebounds and 13 games with double digit rebounds … His scoring went up this year and he was always confident banging down low and getting to the rim … His field goal percentage at the rim was a superb 75 percent … For as good as his paint presence was, he shot just as effectively from mid-range and three … In fact, he had just about an even split between his field goal locations (mid-range and three-point shots each were about 1/3 and shots at the rim were close to 25 percent) … If there is one thing to compliment Oliver on, it’s the fact that he came back to school this year and did what so many have failed to do: improve his skills and increase his draft stock … It’s always a huge risk but he did it … His scoring went up, his shot blocking got better, he established himself as a rim protector and glass eater and he elevated his team as a leader and led them into the Big Dance (where he played very well) … Versatility is one of the most heavily valued traits by NBA teams and execs and Oliver has it … He can score in a multitude of ways, has speed to blow by defenders off the dribble and he outworks bigger players down low in the trenches … He plays above the rim with his great physical tool set and we can’t talk about Oliver without talking about the explosiveness he has at the rim … He is so aggressive and thunderous when he dunks, he is essentially assaulting the rim with bad intentions …","For all those positives to look at, there should be caution moving forward on him … For one, he never played elite talent … He played in the Mountain West, a mid major conference and rarely against power conference schools … He made one NCAA Tournament game and was bounced in the first round (even though he played very well) … His scoring was far too inconsistent and some scouts question his motor and desire to dominate … Some games he would go off in the high 20’s of points, and some he went cold and never cracked double digits in points … He also only shot 24 percent of his shots at the rim this past season, which isn’t bad since he was diversifying his shot selections but it wasn’t’ ideal … For a player with his size and speed attributes, one would expect him to be driving and dominating around the basket more …   Instead, he settled too often for outside jumpers and his offensive game has not become diversified … His ability to knock down 3s adds intrigue, but he hasn’t developed much of a post game … His vision has not improved in college … Too frequently he displayed tunnel vision and put his head down, failing to spot open players when he was double teamed or drove to the basket … He must improve this if he wants to be a stretch forward in the NBA … Speaking of stretch forward, what position will Oliver play? He lacks great height and bulk to be a power forward and isn;t skilled enough for small forward … Scouts have also knocked Oliver for his low basketball I.Q … Too often this was displayed on defense when he left his assignments or broke away from schemes. And even though he was a very good shot blokcer, as a small power forward, that skill doesn;t always translate …  Scouts also questioned his heart and consistency, since his senior season was marred by multiple games of very high numbers and games of very low numbers … If your passion or effort level are in question, that’s not a good sign to execs …",80,240,20.96

Johnathan Motley,-1,"An extremely long, rangy big man with a versatile offensive game, Johnathan Motley has made the most of the opportunity as Baylor’s top dog after Taurean Prince has made the transition to the NBA. Measuring 6’9’’ in shoes, Motley sports a massive 7’3.5’’ wingspan and a 9’3’’ standing reach, which are both elite measurements for a power forward. He’s filled out nicely over the yeas as well, and weighs in at a strong 232 pounds (up about 30 lbs since his high school days).  Motley also possesses great end to end speed, and the ability to really get out on the break. Athletically, he’s a quick leaper as well, who can get off the ground nicely. Johnathan has also been able to transition into a number one option at the collegiate level (16.3 ppg). He’s done so by using a solid mid range game (42.5% on jump shots according to Hoop-Math.com) as well as the ability to post up on the block and use a nice hook over either shoulder. Motley’s has a high release on his jumper, and good touch, even on fade aways and turn arounds. He’s also a terrific offensive rebounder and has already tallied 19 put-backs as a part of hauling in 2.9 offensive rebounds per game (through 12-31-2016). He’s also shown a new part of his game this season, and that is passing out of the post. Motley is averaging a career high 2.2 assists per game, and has shown the smarts to make good passes out of double teams, now that he’s a larger focus of Baylor’s offense. Defensively, he’s solid and has shown the ability to move laterally and disrupt the passing lanes in Baylor’s zone defense. While zone is not a common set in the NBA, he has the athletic tools, and awareness to transition into at least a solid defender who can mop up defensive rebounds at a high rate.","Johnathan has a really good mid range game, but in the spacing heavy NBA landscape of today, you’d like your stretch 4 to have 3 point range. His percentage this season is a very good .385%, but it’s on limited attempts (5-13) so it’s difficult to know if that’s an accurate representation of his range. Motley is surprisingly not a high level shot blocker, despite his great length. He blocks just 1 shot per game at Baylor, and while Jo Lual-Acuil acts as the Bears’ primary rim protector, you’d still like to see more swats from a guy sporting a 9’3’’ standing reach. Motley has shown the ability to block 3 or 4 shots in a game, though, so this could be improved upon as the year progresses. He’s also improved his FT shooting this season to a respectable 68%, but you’d like to see him get that over 70%, but I think that is not out of the question when looking at his continued growth. Motley is a red shirt, so he’ll turn 22 at the and of his junior season.",81,240,22.15

Charles Cooke,-1,"Great basketball body for a shooting guard, with a 6’11.5 wingspan and 8’7 standing reach … Smooth, fluid athlete as well, and while he may not seem like he jumps out of the gym can play some above the rim … Improved his long-range shooting upon transferring from James Madison to Dayton, was at 108-272 (39.7%) 3PT during his last two college seasons … Was involved in a lot of pick-and-roll action as the ball handler and used it very well going to the basket or freeing himself for shots … Was also quite willing to use his size, length advantage over smaller defenders, plus went to the line over 5 times per game as a senior, which is slightly below what he had done the two years previous … Became much more of a distributor as a senior, with his aggressive style leading to lanes for cutters, made a number of solid reads with a 1.35:1 assist-to-turnover ratio (2.8 apg-2.1 topg) … Not a bad rebounder for a guard, pretty decent nose for the ball and attacks when in his space … Length and speed allow him some recovery ability on defense, will tend to keep with the play even if he gets beat and seems to have tools to work with on that end of the floor … Shows timing and change of speed as a driver, which leads to either open paths for finishes or ability to draw contact … Quick leaper and quick reaction time, which really helps on both sides of court … Uses crossovers, hesitations as a dribbler, even has a runner, floater and hook game near hoop … Very good at challenging shots, even had some surprising timing as a shot blocker … Conditioning looks to be a strong suit logged over 31.6 mpg during his last three seasons in college … Gets low, moves pretty well laterally and he shows good effort on defense, which is even more of a positive sign towards his progression … Transition play is not necessarily a standout quality of his, but he can certainly get out and run, finish on the break … Looks to have a good attitude and intensity behind him, appears to have a level of maturity that should bode well moving forward","His touch around the hoop, and even as a jump shooter inside the arc is sort of a reason for concern … Would often force shots or take bad angles, or leave the ball a bit short … Nearly 23-years old and while he definitely showed improvement as a playmaker as a senior, other areas of his game remaining pretty close to the same level, which leads to questions about his offense moving forward … Was not very comfortable shooting off of the bounce, struggled from the short and mid-range as a shooter as well … Can at times gamble and lose focus defensively, be caught off balance on fakes … Did not show much isolation ability and while he can dribble in space and as a handler in the pick-and-roll, his first step is not incredibly explosive and he will have issues getting to the basket … Finished college as a 70.2% FT shooter, which is not really a great indication as far as success from NBA long-range, or in terms of his all-around shooting … Can certainly stand to gain some strength and while he does have a solid frame, NBA guards will be a tough test for him to start … At times could get lost out of the game, when he is guarded to closely can force the issue and make bad plays, take bad shots … Seemed to have his worst games against the best opponents, could struggle going up against higher level competition where he was the focus, including both of Dayton’s first round NCAA Tournament exit games and against ranked opponents … Did not really do much coming off of screens, and even with his physical gifts was not really able to ever get much of a chance to post-up … Was the focal point of Dayton’s offense, and while his ability as a pick-and-roll ball handler should serve well, still a question as to what quality he will bring as a NBA role player … Already 22-years old, will turn 23 shortly after draft, which may limit what some may see as his potential to get much beyond where he is",77,190,22.99
Kobi Simmons,-1,"Simmons is a speedy combo guard that can really score the basketball … This past season at Arizona, he did not often have the opportunity to display his full offensive repertoire in a crowded backcourt … However, Simmons came out of a loaded freshman class, and is one of the best perimeter scorers in the crop … He has a variety of moves once he gets into the paint, where he can finish acrobatically with wither hand … Where he really stands out is that he can really knock down shots off the dribble … He has an excellent pull-up jumper in his arsenal, which is essential in the NBA for a point guard … He does a good job of using screens and moving well without the ball to get himself open looks, but he also excels at creating offense for himself … Simmons additionally has a very quick first step, which means defenders have to give up space to him in order to slow him down off the dribble … This is what makes him difficult to guard, as the defense has to respect his driving ability, but he also complements it well with his perimeter scoring off the dribble … Simmons is not a true point guard, but he has the size to play either backcourt position, whether that be the point man or a scoring 2 guard, at 6-5 with solid length … He is rhythm shooter who has the ability to catch fire at times from the outside. He also does a good job of absorbing contact at the rim and getting to the free throw line, where he does a nice job of converting (77.5% this season) … One of the most appealing aspects of Simmons’ game is that he is a gifted athlete … In his senior year of high school, his vertical leap was measured to be at 42”, and that could increase further as his frame fills out in the next couple of years … His combination of size and elite quickness and athleticism give him intriguing upside as a defensive player … Simmons is already a good on-ball defender, but he has the potential to be a lockdown defensive stopper at the next level if he applies himself and gets stronger, with his ability to guard multiple positions … He also has great instincts as an off-the-ball defender, leading Arizona with nine charges taken this season … There is a lot of upside for Simmons, and he could potentially become an excellent NBA player.","As good as Simmons is with the ball in his hands at creating offense, he isn’t enough of a facilitator … He does not look to pass very often when he gets into the lane, as he is constantly looking for his own shots when he’s on the floor … He is much more of an isolation player at this stage, and he struggles to operate out of the pick-and-roll as a playmaker, which is a vital tool for success in the NBA as a lead guard … Simmons played 23.5 minutes per game at Arizona this past season, but he only averaged two assists per contest, a sign that his playmaking instincts need to improve …  He did not turn the ball over that frequently, coughing it up 1.2 times per game, but he has a tendency to over dribble and play out of control, which leads to bad turnovers … Maturity and attitude are points that scouts note that he must improve upon … His attitude came under fire after Trier returned to the team at midseason and he was visibly unhappy with coming off the bench. His play suffered as he stopped moving the ball as willingly, and Coach Miller was forced to cut his minutes futher … If he wants to make it as a point guard in the association, it is imperative that he improves his decision-making and starts getting his teammates more involved … Inefficiency is also a concern for Simmons right now … He shot just 39.5% from the field in his freshman season, which is largely the result of subpar shot selection … As good as he is off the dribble, he needs to improve his consistency as a spot-up shooter, as he made only 32% of his threes this season … In the NBA, it is so difficult to be a consistent scorer without a reliable jump shot, so this needs to be a priority … Maybe the biggest concern for now is adding strength to his slender frame. He weighs less than 200 pounds, which will be a problem at the next level when matched up with bigger guards in the NBA … However, he is still just 19 years old, so he should develop physically with time … A kid with a very high ""situational dependency"" at the next level for him to reach his potential … Could have used an additional season in college to improve his skill level, however he apparently was always of the mindset that he was a one and done player …",76,170,19.98

He can be a bit over aggressive at times defending closeouts, but he has the length to recover and alter shots at the rim even after being beat off the dribble … He can cover a lot of ground with his mobility and length from both inside and out. As he continues to mature and understand defensive positioning, he will become an absolute force on this side of the floor … He also has the ability to be a weapon on the offensive glass, especially finding second chance points off of put backs … He has the size and explosiveness to corral the ball off the rim, and he is a quick jumper … Adding a little more to his offensive skillset and becoming more physical in the paint will be the main variables in determining if he reaches his full potential … Comanche is a little more raw than your average 20-year old, but he possesses some unique characteristics that can’t be taught, so it will be interesting to see if his production can begin to catch up to his potential …","Despite his plus length, one of the biggest knocks on Comanche is his lack of strength … Weighing just 215 pounds, this weakness was exploited numerous tmes over the past two seasons at Arizona … Against stronger and more physical defenders he was often bullied in the paint and struggled to finish through contact … At times last season the game appeared to move too quickly for Comanche on both ends of the floor, which says that his feel for the game is not there yet … This is likely one of the main reasons he saw such limited playing time in both years … Besides his length and athleticism, he doesn’t have a go to skill yet offensively, as he is limited to mostly put backs, backdoor cuts, and drop off passes … He shot 57% from the field last season, but most of those opportunities were uncontested finishes … His lack of strength was more of a factor in his inability to finish around the rim in traffic when he didn’t have the time or space to load up … He also does not have elite hands, as he did not show great ability to haul in off target passes or rebound out his area consistently … With Comanche’s combination of physical tools, one would think he would be a pretty good rebounder, but he still has some developing to do in this area … His lack of strength really hinders his ability to box out bigger guys on the interior, and be pushed out of position … While he definitely has great upside as a rebounder, he will have to become much more physical and continue to add strength to ever maximize his athleticism and translate it to better production on the glass.",83,215,21.2
