Anthony Bennett,1,"Bennett has expanded his game offensively and become almost unguardable during his first season of college ball … Bennett’s transition to the college game has been seamless … What grabs your attention about Bennett is his focus and intensity … Imposing physical specimen. Huge hands, wide shoulders and an enormous wingspan gives him great ability to dunk the ball with power … He’s very athletic, long, quick & fast. With a 7’1 wingspan & impressive inch vertical he poses nightmare problems in terms of mismatches … Able to overpower smaller defenders & bigger defenders get ""outquicked"" and often dunked on … Bennett is best at the power game in the paint, where at least 70 % of his scoring total comes from … When charting his shots on the season he has literally scored from every power spot on the floor … He favors the right side of the floor consisting of floaters, tip ins, reverse layups & dunks 60% of the time. Bennett’s 42 dunks put him among the country’s leaders. Bennett has made 23 3 pointers this season and averages 1 make per game. Bennett’s sweet spot is the left perimeter where he’s made 40% of his 3 pointers. His go to midrange move is his face up jumper from the right baseline … Two words that bode well for Bennett’s future are productivity and efficiency … He is so efficient that if he played 40 minutes per game he would average 26.2 points per game … He has the innate ability to create spacing which helps him to score whether it’s freezing a defender with a jab step or flaring off of a screen to catch & shoot or flat out blowing by a defender for a power dunk … Bennett continually shows his versatility which raises his intrigue … Bennett’s footwork is excellent, especially for someone of his size. Along with his footwork, Bennett’s shooting mechanics are very good. His form never changes on his shot. His shoulders are always squared and facing the basket. His release point is the same & even his misses look good … Bennett is extremely adept at drawing fouls and goes to the stripe an average of 6 times per game, knocking down 75% of his free throws … Bennett is an adept ball handler and has gone coast to coast 4 times this season. He maintains a low dribble and is rarely caught upright. Based upon playing 40 minutes, he averages only 2 turnovers. As stated earlier, with his tremendous skill set & ability to draw fouls he commands a great deal of attention defensively …","Somewhat of a tweener as he is slightly undersized for a full time PF (though that’s likely his future position) and slow defensively to play the SF position … The major concern for Bennett going into this season was his health. His prep career was marred with injuries as he was not able to finish out either his junior or senior seasons. On the positive side he hasn’t had any such problems in college having not missed a single practice much less game … There are some questions about his toughness. He’s got a massive frame with incredible strength, but for as big and strong as he is, it doesn’t always appear that he seeks out contact, or play with ferocity on the boards … While averaging a team high 8 rebounds a game, at times he appears disinterested defensively. In Bennett’s defense he spent the beginning of the season defending the opposition’s Center until teammate Khem Birch became eligible, but defending is also about desire.",79,240,20.3
Victor Oladipo,2,"Explosive athlete who plays with great energy and aggression on both ends of the floor … Fearless slasher, with potential to be dangerous as a transition player … Plays passing lanes very well, and has a great nose for the ball … Improved his jump shot considerably, known for having a fantastic work ethic … Improvement over the past year has been remarkable and a testament to his work ethic. Shows a great will to improve, by all reports a fantastic kid and considered very coachable … Quite strong, very good at playing prevent defense and establishing position …  Shot selection was highly efficient during his junior season, seemed to know his role and limitations … Has potential as a passer, though still keeps it quite simple … Follows shots really well, does not give up on plays and good at creating turnovers in the backcourt … Length and timing to block shots occasionally, good help defender … Worked on his handle and showed noticeable improvement during his final season at IU … Potentially can become a player with blow by quickness due to his great speed … Pesky defender who prides himself on guarding the other team’s best perimeter scorer … Could guard multiple positions, even at the NBA level … Though he did not average over 30 mpg, conditioning and stamina appear to be top notch, should be able to log a good number of minutes","Still very much a work in progress as a complete offensive player … Was not even on team’s radars as a first rounder going into junior season. Begging the question, did he overachieve? … Despite improving his outside shot, had a very limited sample size from long distance and as a midrange jump shooter … Has a difficult time creating offense off of the dribble, and this is an area that arguable may not improve a ton … Has never been counted on as a featured offensive threat, something that will more than likely be expected of him in his current draft range … Despite his attacking nature and great athleticism, only got to the line for 3.6 FTA … Forced into a high number of turnovers, particularly when trying to create in isolation … Due to his aggressive nature, can get into foul trouble, will need to learn to let certain things go in order to not to pick up cheap fouls … No real go-to move as an offensive player, especially considering he will be going up against players close to his size, quickness in the NBA … More bark than bite? His defensive analytics did not necessarily follow his reputation as a shut down defender, which could be something to monitor … Will he still manage to stay as efficient as his junior year percentages dictated once he is asked to do more offensively?",76,213,21.16
Otto Porter,3,"Porter is a multi-skilled small forward possessing tremendous length (7’1 wingspan) and veteran basketball savvy at 19-years of age. He’s in constant motion away from the ball, roaming the baseline, cutting backdoor or settling into soft spots. Utilizes that same motor to get out in the open court and runs exceedingly well end to end; averages 1.45 PPP in transition. Plays to his strengths and works hard to ameliorate areas of weakness. He upped his scoring output from 9.7 as a freshman to 16.2 as a sophomore (48% FG). The key ingredient to his offensive explosion was improved long-range proficiency, from 23% to 42% (12 makes to 43). 51% adjusted FG% in spot up opportunities. Highly efficient in the mid-range from either elbow — catch and shoot coming off screens (or working the middle of 2-3) and dribbling into jumpers with one or two habit bounces. His unorthodox style and arm length frequently result in contact; makes excellent use of the pump fake. He gets to the free throw stripe 5 times per game and converts at 77%. Prudent decision maker with ball in hand when asked to facilitate in the Princeton system- 2.7:1.5 assist: turnover ratio. In sync with teammates and uses the dribble to create better passing angles. His feel for the game and nose for the ball are highlighted on the boards. His length/motor/instincts (reading caroms) allow him to chase down misses outside of his area (7.5 REB). Contests every jump shot– even when a shooter creates space, his wingspan negates a clear look (0.9 BLK). Hedges screens aggressively and disrupts hand-offs (1.8 STL). Porter was a late bloomer that did not play on the AAU circuit. Finished classes after declaring for the draft and gets the” big picture”. Stable performer, never see him flustered.","Smooth run/jump athlete but missing the trademark explosion of a lottery talent. The power quotient is noticeably absent as well. While muscle definition is more noticeable, he has not added substantial bulk in his two years (from 200 to 205). It appears he has the broad shoulders to support more weight. He lacks the tools to impose his will on the game. Has difficulty creating clean looks for himself- off the dribble creativity is elementary and he’s more slippery/slithery than quick. Aptitude shooting off the bounce is often condensed to 1 or 2 dribbles, doesn’t rise up and elevate off hard drives. Not a consistent breakdown candidate, dependent on another playmaker or garbage buckets in the half court. Limited albeit diverse role player. Porter was utilized as a “pick and pop” threat just three times all season, failing to showcase potentially his greatest attribute as an undersized 4. His jump shot mechanics are awkward with elbows out and funky sidespin rotation. To his credit, he’s made it work a la Shawn Marion. Top-notch defender in all situations that don’t require side to side movement in open space. There are clear shortcomings in the lateral quickness department, which he masks with makeup speed and length.Injury note: He wore a right knee brace during the season’s final month after banging knees on February 20th.",81,200,20.08
Cody Zeller,4,"Bigman with an excellent basketball IQ and all around athlete … A gazelle. Runs the floor extremely well for a 7 footer. He’s also has great body control for a center, showing unusual ability to convert plays on the break … Plays with great energy, a focused and intense competitor … Highly unselfish, team guy and a willing passer with good vision for a big … Puts winning and his team over individual accolades … Fundamentally sound. Great feel for the game. Never seems to be in a rush and very deliberate with his moves … Shows solid ability to face up and knock down mid-range jumpshots … Displays good hands, rarely fumbles the ball … Good rebounder, good technique, anticipation, getting low and boxing out … A solid defender. Uses his size well to blanket opponents. Stays between his man and the basket and doesn’t gamble or bite on fakes easily … Hard working kid, who should only improve over time and become a very solid NBA player … Shows a willingness to battle in the post, and gets to the line at a good rate where he converts 75%, (averaging 5 of 7 per game) … Ceiling may be lower than some, but his basement is higher than most … Upperbody, while still in need of more strength has shown solid improvement in his 2 year Indiana career … Made a solid decision returning to Indiana for sophomore year as he enters the NBA with a better NBA body and overall readiness … In a draft with few sure things, Zeller will be a desirable prospect as a player with little bust potential … Was very successful matching up with Anthony Davis as a freshman. Showed confidence, and played him to a standstill scoring over him using great ball fakes, and helped IU get the upset victory over the eventual National Champions … Durable. Never missed a game in his 2 year career … Post game is solid, using good foot work and providing a solid target for post entry passes. Shows a solid understanding of the basics and just needs to develop more diversity to his moves … Has the size and versatility to play either the 4 or 5 positions … Should be able to come in and contribute immediately, which is more than can be said for most of the draft prospects this year … Doesn’t have any major holes in his game …","Not a shot blocker or much of a presence on the defensive end. Can be overwhelmed by stronger and more explosive opponents … While very composed, his moves can be too predictable, leading to blocked shots … Unselfish to a fault. May never be a huge scorer in the league … Seems to be more comfortable in a secondary role. Lacks an alpha male personality. As the team’s most talented player, it was clear that Indiana could have used a superstar, vocal leader, but he deferred to teammate Victor Oladipo, who assumed the role of team’s go to player and inspirational leader. Should look to be more vocal … Lacks great post moves. Surprisingly, his post game did not show the development in his sophomore season that many expected. Still has a lot of work to do to become an effective offensive player on the block … Should look to develop a go to move on the block … Humble to a fault. What makes him a solid player, patience and unselfishness, may also keep him from greatness. He lacks a fiery personality, and appears more comfortable being one of the guys instead of THE guy … Really struggled late in the year, particularly in the tournament. Syracuse’s length and 2-3 zone collapsed on him, and really limited his effectiveness. His athleticism appeared so ordinary, some wondered if he had an injury going on … Did not make the significant jump in productivity in his sophomore year, in fact, his field goal percentage fell of significantly from FR to SO season … Sort of a jack of all trades, master of none type …",84,230,20.74
Alex Len,5,"Athletic specimen at 7’1 with highly intriguing physical canvas … He’s a legit 5-man with incredible coordination and agility for his size … Gets up and down the court with ultimate comfort at 255 pounds … Back to the basket game is on the incline- did a much better job establishing and holding position as a sophomore … Quick and decisive moves, predominantly over his left shoulder … Effortless leaping ability and 7’3.5 wingspan result in frequent high percentage looks (53% FG), many above the rim … Active and willing mover without the ball, averaging 1.48 PPP on basket cuts (52 possessions) … Consistent shooting mechanics with significant room for development; occasionally will flash confidence letting fly in the mid-range … 69% free throw shooter … Willing passing with burgeoning feel for the game (1 APG) … He’s added 30 pounds since arriving on campus from his professional club in the Ukraine … Imposing upper body with wide set shoulders, supporting additional muscle should not be a concern … One rebound every 3.3 minutes on the floor … He possesses all the tools to be a prolific rebounder on both backboards (2.9 ORPG) … Intimidating presence in the middle filling the role of rim protector (2.1 BLK) … Capable of deterring shots both on ball and weakside … Mobile defensively, unafraid to engage the pick and roll ball handler … Moves well laterally and retreats on balance. Len will turn 20 on June 16th …","Len remains a raw product when forced to make a move outside of a few feet … Limited resources with ball in hand … Face up game is not a part of his repertoire despite high level agility compared to his center counterparts- same can be proclaimed for his effectiveness, or lack thereof, in the pick and pop … Nuances of the P&R need cultivation… Over time he should become a natural rolling to the hoop. Assertiveness and dominant mindset not yet trademarks, as buttressed by his underwhelming 8.5 FGA and 4 FTA per game … Lower body/base must get stronger to defend the post and maintain position on the offensive block … Often found himself in foul trouble with defensive discipline a work in progress … After declaring for the draft it was revealed he would miss 4-6 months of practice time with a stress fracture in his ankle … It should be noted that ankle issues were a common theme during his two years at College Park … Unable to participate in combine drills where he would have been an ideal candidate to impress in the athletic testing …",85,255,20.04
Nerlens Noel,6,"One of the best pure shot blockers to come along in a number of years … He’s a more explosive leaper and has better on ball shot blocking ability than last year’s UK freshman intimidator Anthony Davis. While Davis had a little better lateral speed and ability to get to shots as a weakside defender, Noel’s ability to deny his man any daylight to the rim and be a rim protector makes him even more dominant, and a potential defensive enforcer for the NBA … An elite level athlete with great quickness and explosive leaping ability … Great length, reported 7’4 wingspan … Showed surprising ability to get steals using his quick hands (2.1 per game), though some of those reach ins will draw fouls and not be as sucessful in the NBA … Must get stronger but has the potential to play both post positions: power forward and center … A good kid, with a strong work ethic … Competes. Plays with great energy and effort … His great length, explosiveness and natural timing which makes him such a dominant shot blocker also makes him a great rebounder and ally oop/put back dunker … Strong rebounder. Shows a willingness to bang inside and fight for rebounds. 9.5 rpg … Good hands to snatch rebounds and make one handed put backs in spectacular fashion … As raw as he is, he seems to have a solid feel for the game and understanding of how to play to his strengths … Showed development in his freshman season, learning to get a wide base, call for the ball, keep it away from guards and make plays, though unpolished, towards the basket … Has developed a little baby hook shot with either hand that has shown some success at times … Shows the ability to face up and get by slower defenders using the dribble … Surprisingly good passer for a bigman. His near 1-1 a/to ratio shows that he passes well and also doesn’t turn the ball over a great deal … His impact on UK has been most apparent after his injury, with the team losing their first game w/out him by 30 to Tennessee … While he lacks much muscle tone, he does show very good aggressiveness attacking the basket and is ""wiry strong"" … While his ACL injury takes some of the luster off of him as a prospect due to the unknowns surrounding him returning to 100%, the fact that he’s so young and today’s technology with athletes such as Adrian Peterson having made such amazing recoveries after surgery helps his cause …","Offensively, Noel’s game is rudimentary. He has shown some development but the general perception is that he will never be a strong offensive player, instead he impacts games with his defense, rebounding and athleticism … Won’t be able to ""out-athleticize"" opponents for baskets at the next level the way he has in college … Scores mainly on put backs and dunks when he gets a clear path to the basket, or when teammates are able to create for him. That being said, his great foot speed allows him to get by inferior opponents off the dribble at times … Post game is very weak, as a high school player he focused too much on trying to face the basket and use ball handling instead of embracing the idea of being a post player all the time. His lack of post moves/instincts are a result … Lacks touch even around the rim as he’s had some painful misses from point blank range, missing by 2 feet from 4 feet away, etc. … Shows quick feet and explosiveness to get by slower defenders but struggles to make any real post moves. His foot work needs a good deal of improvement … His shooting ability is a major weakness as his lack of a crisp form is apparent when he shoots from the FT line. Lacks a clean, smooth motion, he slings the ball, pushing it instead of allowing his wrists to have a natural release … Legs are alarmingly thin and there could be some concern that the knee injury came as a result of his lack of leg strength … Narrow shoulders will challenge his ability to bulk up considerably. Though there are plenty of NBA bigmen that have had success in the 230 range (which is likely where he will wind up) … His 53% ft shooting illustrates his lack of shooting fundamentals … Unusual athlete, while on one hand he’s an elite level run jump guy with tremendous reflexes and quickness, he plays extremely upright and is stiff and lacking fluidity in some regards …",83,206,19.23
Ben McLemore,7,"Prototypical 2-guard with a mouth watering combination of athleticism and shooting ability … A top shelf athlete with spectacular leaping ability and body control … Appears to have just scratched the surface of his abilities in his one season of college ball … Without question has elite level NBA 2 guard potential with the talent to eventually place himself among the top shooting guards in the league in his prime … Shooting efficiency was off the charts for a freshman, hitting 50% FG, 42% 3p and 87% from the line (totaling 179, he was a point away from being in the 180 club) More efficient shooting than Steph Curry was in his freshman season at Davidson (172) … Smooth operator. His jump shot is absolutely a thing of beauty and rarely do you find such a gorgeous stroke on such a gifted athlete … Shoots with a fluid and concise motion and takes the same shot every time. Gets excellent elevation and has a quick release … Has range out to college 3, and there’s no reason to think he won’t be able to extend to the NBA line … If he plays with a top level PG, he will be deadly in catch and shoot situations … His pull up off the dribble shows a lot of potential, as does his ability to blow by defenders due to a quick first step … Ball handling potential is there. Has much better ball handling ability than he’s been given credit for. Shows one and two dribble pull up skills, plus can utilize three and four dribble moves to get to the rim … When asked to isolate, has done a good job of creating off the dribble, though was rarely asked to be a primary ball handler, or ISO, and spent most of his time running off screens for spot up looks … Excellent off the ball, using constant motion to tire out opponents and has been coached well to wait for screens and run his man off them to free himself for looks … Great at finding seems in the defense, running the baseline for ally oop dunks … Has a chance to be an excellent defender due to his length and lateral speed. Despite their reputations, McLemore actually graded out much higher on overall defense in Synergy analytical statistics than Victor Olidipo … McLemore allowed .625 PPP (points per possession) scoring in the 89 percentile (Oladipo .856 PPP and in the 39th percentile) Granted Oladipo has better ISO defensive analytics … Unselfish, team player who shows solid ability to pass the ball for an off guard (even a/to ratio) … Good size at 6’4.75 in shoes with a 6’7.75 wingspan … Persevered through a rough upbringing showing a fortitude and inner strength …","""Lacks assertiveness"" and ""passivity"" are the two most common criticisms that have been made about him. Is it possible that the bar was set a little high for a freshman that averaged 15.9 ppg on highly efficient numbers? … Still must learn how to operate in pressure situations and develop focus and mental toughness … It’s easy to confuse a lack of focus for a lack of passion, and it’s a real possibility that his struggles were more related to inexperience and concentration lapses instead of competitiveness or mental toughness issues … A young and naive kid, there are some concerns about how he will handle all of NBA’s off court temptations and not get caught up in the ""lifestyle"". By all accounts a good kid, who just needs solid people around him steering him in the right direction, making positive decisions … Just one season of college ball after redshirting his first year at Kansas due to Academics … Some worry about his maturity level and confidence after his interviews and workouts. He reportedly was out of shape and unprepared during the draft process … Extremely humble kid. May need time to grow and mature, develop a better feel for the game, defensive spacing, etc. He will likely gain confidence and develop a swagger in time … The truth is he’s a great kid who’s just naive, like most 20 year olds … As one scout put it, ""Just imagine what he’ll be like when he gets some confidence and hits his stride"" … Had one dreadful performance against North Carolina (2 pts 0-9 fg) during their tourney run in which he disappeared and somewhat crumbled under the pressure, and detractors point to this game as proof that he lacks a killer instinct or the ""alpha dog"" personality. In reality the same criticisms could be made about Bradley Beal for ""running from the basketball"" in the key minutes of Florida’s loss to Louisville in the NCAA tournament. McLemore bounced back with 20 pts on 8-15 in their next and last game vs. Michigan … Sometimes the moment overcomes players and only a fool would judge a player based on one college performance … Needs to work on his ISO game, become a better ball handler and not be so careless turning the ball over … Where McLemore struggled defensively was in isolation, showing a need to expand his feel for the game, focus on fundamentals, get lower and not bite on fakes as heavily. Shows solid effort, he just needs to make a better effort of getting low, anticipating, and not allowing opponents to get by him on penetration … Had an extremely tough upbringing so there are some concerns about how he will be able to handle immediate riches … Two years at Kansas were crucial for his maturity and long term development off the court, but has a bigger adjustment curve than the average prospect and needs time and patience from the team that invests a pick in him …",77,190,20.39
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,8,"Natural scoring ability (18.5 PPG) and effortless range (37% 3PT) in a classic shooting guard frame. He displayed massive improvement from freshman to sophomore campaigns. A more relaxed shooter in his second year, fully utilizing his foundation for better balance to spring into the shot. Solid elevation and consistent point of release. The trey is his layup. One-man show at Georgia — any possession where he found space to fire was a good possession. Pick and roll was usually the offensive set of choice. He delivered 1.03 PPP in 97 overall P&R possessions, and 1.275 PPP when running right side P&R. Highly efficient dribbling into a deep three or pulling up off a hard left drive. Posted a 58.8% Adjusted Field Goal Percentage in spot up opportunities and 50% off a screen. Quick release with catch and shoot in one harmonious motion. Got to the free throw stripe 5.3 times per game as a sophomore, up from 2.5 as a frosh (earned FT’s in 19.2% of transition possessions). High riser off of one-foot behind a head of steam. Outstanding top end speed. One of the top rebounding guards in the nation (7.1 REB) – very much committed to finishing defensive trips and optimizing his 6’8 wingspan. Elite defensive capabilities: gets into his man, moves well side to side, has the length to disrupt shots and plays passing lanes tenaciously (2 SPG). Defense into offense is his forte. Shooting specialist with size and defensive/rebounding skills is never a bad classification.","Caldwell-Pope’s repertoire is highly dependent on perimeter accuracy. Often takes the easy way out, settling for long range bombs rather than using his athleticism. 52% of his shots come from behind the arc. Smooth athlete, but lacks short range quickness or explosiveness — while he uses the dribble adeptly to buy space for jumpers (hesitation and step back), he does not possess blow by or shake up handles to get all the way to the rim. Attack needs to be encouraged. Adding strength would promote a more aggressive mentality as well. Does not serve as a facilitator with the ball in his hands, rarely aiding the cause of teammates. Posted a negative assist: turnover ratio of 1.8:2. Defensive prowess notwithstanding, he can be flighty at times and choose potential rewards over standard awareness; a trait not aided by his team’s inability to score.Combine notes: KCP excelled in the speed and agility drills (top-five in lane agility and ¾ court sprint), but flopped in maximum vertical (34.5) and standing vertical (29).",78,205,20.37
Trey Burke,9,"Point guard with tremendous heart and determination … Many of the cliche attributes fit him: A natural born killer. Fearless warrior. Fierce competitor. Has a will to win. Will battle tooth and nail on every possession. Mind over matter guy who brings intangibles that don’t show up on the box score. Clutch performer who seems to shine when it matters most … A tremendous leader. Relishes the opportunity to take the club on his back and carry them to victory … Shows great consistency. Comes to play every game and had just a small handful of games where he didn’t score at least 15 points … While scoring is his forte, his ability to run the team and make plays for others, as well as maintaining above a 3-to-1 ast/to ratio is enough to label him a legitimate point guard … Has really evolved as a floor general, dictating the tempo and showing the patience to allow plays to develop and find teammates … A strong ball handler, though not elite level … Shows the ability to find teammates on drive and kicks … Tremedous in pick and roll situations … His numbers show how effective he is averaging 18.9 ppg, 47% from the floor, 39% from 3, 80% from the line, and a 6.8 to 2.2 a/to ratio … Validated his 3 point shooting ability by hitting a high volume (2 per game) … Has a surprising 6’5 wingspan, giving him some additional length to get shots off and finish at the rim … A pesky defender showing excellent ability to anticipate an opposing guard’s next move and get his hands in to strip the ball away … Shows solid body strength giving him the ability to stay on balance when contact occurs and finish off drives … Very effective in catch and shoot situations, playing off the ball … Also tremendous pulling up for shots off the dribble …","Undersized for the PG position and could struggle some to compete with bigger, quicker and more athletic point guards at the NBA level … Scouts worry that he may run into similar problems as 2011 top 10 pick Kemba Walker: having many passes deflected due to his size and having to work twice as hard (defensively and getting shots off) on a game to game basis due to his size. Can he be a starting PG, and if so can he do it on on a winning team? Due to being undersized, these questions must be asked … He doesn’t show the jitterbug quickness to gain separation on quicker guards which is a concern considering his size … Not the most athletic guard. Solid but not spectacular. Not a player that will dunk in traffic or be a dynamic finisher … His numbers show that he’s more effective in the half court than in transition … A better scorer than distributor, though his vision and passing ability shows flashes … Despite averaging 6.8 apg, scouts aren’t completely sold on his vision and ability to make everyone around him better … Needs to work on his pick and roll skills … As clutch a player as he is, his ISO ability is compromised by a lack of elite speed off the dribble and average first step … Much more effective going to his right. Will need to work on using his left hand and ability to go left in order for team’s not to overplay him to one side, limiting his effectiveness … Should look to add a tear drop to his arsenal. He won’t always be able to get shots off close to the rim, so adding an effective runner will help him when attacking the paint at the next level …",73,190,20.64
CJ McCollum,10,"Combination guard whose game is marked by a lethal capacity for scoring … Averaged 21.9 points per game in 3 ½ season in Bethlehem … His off the dribble variety is elite—hesitation, rocker and crossover—excellent shiftiness and ability to burst through an open seam … He can score from anywhere, a truly unpredictable defensive assignment in the half court … Highly efficient in both isolation offense and the pick & roll, resulting in a score % of 49.2% and 45.7% as a senior in each respective situation … Renowned for his comfort level dribbling into a jumper from mid-range or distance; he’s also above 1 PPP shooting off screens and spotting up … He converted 33 three-pointers (52%) in 12 games last season … Hunts cheap points at the free throw line (6.7 attempts for his career, 82% accuracy) – has added 35-40 pounds since first arriving on campus and shows a proclivity for using his 200 lb. frame to draw contact … Capable of making appropriate in-air body adjustments following a bump … Plays with a palpable air of confidence; for every defensive design, he has the ability to counter … Cool under pressure in the deciding moments of the biggest games … Well-schooled and intelligent, operates like he’s seen it all before … Singlehandedly carried Lehigh to heights unforeseen. Plays well within the team concept, yet still possesses the one on one package to break away from it when necessary. 6’6 wingspan– major factor on both backboards (6.3 career, 7.8 sophomore) and creates absolute havoc in passing lanes (2.1 steals) … From a mental acuity and physical maturity standpoint, he’s ready.","McCollum will need to further cultivate his lead guard and team running skills at the next level … At this point, he profiles as more of a natural scoring, combo guard … At 6’3, his primary position will need to be at the point … 2.7:2.4 collegiate assist: turnover ratio spotlights his weaknesses in facilitating for teammates (as well as lack of a potent surrounding cast) … His most popular media comparison, Damian Lillard, averaged 4 assists per game his senior year … Lacks explosive quickness or leaping ability — solid athlete, but at least in part reliant on court craft and change of pace to make due … Three-point stroke could use fine tuning (32% sophomore, 34% junior), but mechanics look good … Level of competition is a legitimate concern. While he showed well against premiere programs (36 against Baylor and 30 against Duke), he was not tested consistently … He was essentially able to coast through Patriot League play and still dominate … Does not have great feet defensively or look fluid moving side to side- his ISO defense is a liability … Missed the final 19 games of 2012-2013 with a broken bone in his foot. McCollum will turn 22 in September.",75,197,21.79

Catches shots at peak height with both hands — for all intents and purposes look like goaltending, but it’s not — he’s just born to swat shots. Always lurking as a secondary defender. Moves comfortably laterally, no concern guarding small forward’s on the perimeter. Reportedly a soft-spoken, shy and gentle kid. Overcame Burkitt’s lymphoma as a 7-year old.","Aiken failed to substantially enhance his frail frame during a three-year collegiate stay. He arrived at 190 and leaves at 199. Struggles against physical treatment. Playing the 4 spot below 200 lbs. is not feasible. Liable to be bodied up and pushed up around by stronger 3’s. Displayed little statistical improvement from sophomore to junior seasons, with regression in efficiency and shot blocking. While his jumpshot, with work, can develop into a useful tool, his over-reliance on the trey has been startling: 2.7 of 7.5 FGA came from behind the arc (25% makes). 35% of St. Joe’s possessions saw Aiken as a spot up target, resulting in .75 PPP and 37.5% adjusted FG. A non-factor in isolation (8 possessions), the pick and roll (29 poss) or in the post (10 poss). Poor ball handling= non-existent face up game. Lacks a calling card strength offensively outside of dunking the ball. Does he have the competitive spirit to realize his physical potential and build up his weak body? On-court demeanor is passive with a capital P. Reluctant to engage in the fray underneath the backboards (5.6 RPG). Needs to break free from gentle persona and find the fire to punish opponents.",81,200,22.76
Elias Harris,-1,"An extremely athletic hybrid type forward, he is capable of doing damage inside and out … Very quick off his feet, he also has a long strides, making him a tough guard out of the triple threat … Plays with an aggressive approach and likes to mix it up around the basket … He will look to dunk almost everything that is in the vicinity of the hoop … His body is fairly mature and his frame shows the potential to still develop … Plays with a lot of energy and likes to get out on the break where he can use his leaping ability to finish in spectacular fashion … He has good hands, allowing him to make difficult catches in traffic … Likes to face up from midrange, and use his quickness to attack opposing bigs … Very aggressive rebounder, and looks to attack the O glass … Brings a lot of experience to the table, as he has battled NBA players on the international stage while playing for Germany’s national team this summer … Defensively, due to his size, strength and lateral quickness, he has the potential to guard a number of positions …","Does not have a natural position, but with his size and frame he will need to become a SF at the next level … Has a hard time creating his own offense, does not posses the best off the dribble game and his back to the basket game is heavily dependent on his athleticism at this point … Will need to show that he can be effective against bigger and more athletic competition, because right now he is able to get away with a lot simply because he can overpower and out-jump the competition… His jump shot needs a lot of work, he has an awkward sling type release that comes behind his head and the results are very inconsistent … His off the dribble jumper is almost non existent , and when he does let it fly, it is all over the place because he shoots it with poor balance and no rhythm … Dribbles the ball too high, which not only slows down his moves, but it also allows the defender a chance to get his hands on the ball … Struggles attacking and finishing with his off hand … He becomes extremely predictable going left with the dribble, as he will spin back to his strong hand almost every time … Has a tendency to get bodied out of position inside and forced to take off balance shots … Lacks touch with in between shots (jump hooks, short jumpers, mini fades, etc.) He is two years older than his class, shortening his ceiling somewhat …",79,240,23.99
Phil Pressey,-1,True point guard with excellent playmaking abilities … Great vision and ability to create scoring opportunities for teammates … 7 assists per game and a 2/1 a/to ratio display solid PG abilities … Deft ball handler … Low center of gravity allows him to quickly change directions and always stay balanced … Shows leadership abilities … Solid spot up shooter …,Severely undersized PG. Not only is he shorter than most NBA PGs  … Lack of size makes it a challenge for him to comfortably see over defenders … Surprisingly struggled in junior season. Seemed to lose confidence and offensive efficiency was disappointing. FG% dipped nearly 50 percentage points from sophomore year … Struggled in pick and roll and ISO situations … Size makes him a defensive liability …,71,177,22.37

Derrick Nix,-1,"Wide bodied big man who improved by leaps and bounds as he got into better condition … Soft hands, nice touch around the basket … Improved his foot work as a back-to-the-basket player greatly … Competitor who shows a lot of toughness, will not back down from physical play … Can pass out of the post and double teams well … Has quick hands to get the occasional steal … Shot nearly 70% from the FT stripe as a senior … Got better on the defensive glass as he lost weight … Managed not to get fouls at a very high rate despite his physical presence in the post … Changed his diet and weighed in at 270 during his senior season, down from 340 when he started as a Spartan … Was a team captain and a fiery, emotional leader during his final year on the team … Surprisingly agile for his size, deceptive near the basket … Solid length, pesky defender and very difficult to post-up due to his strength … Deceptively quick feet laterally …","While he has lost weight, his conditioning still can use work and is something that will have to be monitored relentlessly … Given his size was not an elite rebounder, left something to desire on both ends of the floor when it comes to hitting the boards … Speed well below average for even the center position … Below the rim player who gets very little lift … FG% went down quite a bit once he was asked to take more of an offensive role … Not ideal height or length for a center … Has not really displayed much ability to stretch the floor, limited to shooting near the basket … At times let his emotions get the better of him, needs to try and keep this under control, especially in game situations",81,270,22.56
Kevin Parrom,-1,"Versatile enough to be serviceable at either wing position … Has some court vision and handle, deceptive off the dribble … Improved efficiency greatly, team was much more effective with him on the floor … Knows his role and does not try to do much out of his comfort zone … Strong body, willing to take contact … Vastly improved as a jump shooter over his 4 seasons at Arizona … Work ethic helped him come back after he was a gun shot victim … Solid length, gives good effort defensively … Decent rebounder, especially as a senior","Lacks lateral quickness … Never started or logged huge minutes … Tends to settle for tough shots at times … Does not possess speed one would want out of a 2 or size one might want from a 3 … One has to question why he never received more playing time, with conditioning possibly playing a factor … Rarely got to the foul line … Not a player who one can really see having the ball in their hands much at the next level, while not quick enough to break through as a catch-and-shoot player",78,220,22.34
Jack Cooley,-1,"Cooley is a big, physical power forward with a high motor … A great rebounder, particularly for his height, thanks to his wide frame and aggressiveness on the boards. Averaged 10.3 RPG, good for 12th in the nation, and was even higher in rebounds per 40 minutes (13.9) … Doesn’t shy away from contact; his bruising style makes him a tenacious rebounder and an aggressive post scorer … An efficient scorer in the post, Cooley shot 58% last season and 60% over the course of his college career … His physical style made him hard to stop around the basket, but he also has soft touch and an effective jump hook, particularly over his left shoulder … Sets good, strong screens and is very effective (60% shooting) off of the pick and roll…A good hustle player who will give 100% effort at the next level … Can score with either hand around the rim…Solid shot blocker (1.2 BPG) … Good at using his big frame to battle for position deep in the post … Good leader who served as tri-captain for Notre Dame this season …","A bit under-sized, especially for a player with a center’s game … Unathletic and cumbersome … Limited shooting range, inconsistent from 15+ feet … Likely too slow to guard NBA power forwards outside of the post, but too small to guard NBA centers … Questions about endurance due to the fact that he never played more than 30 minutes per game in college … Showed little improvement from junior to senior year and his shooting percentage and blocks per game decreased significantly … Has few consistent post moves, as much of his scoring is based on being bigger and stronger than his defender, an advantage he won’t always have in the pros …",81,245,22.25
Durand Scott,-1,"Creative one-on-one combo guard with an attacking predisposition … Greatest strength is penetrating off isolations, changing gears utilizing a devastating hesitation dribble- cradling the rock usually looking to score (12.9 PPG) … Good speed when able to reach 6th gear and gather momentum … Once he gets a step, gets to the rim quickly … Uses his strong frame and length to separate from defenders and create opportunities in the paint … Does not necessarily possess explosive quickness, but makes efficient use of movements … He’s slithery in the paint … Completes plays through contact with either hand. Shot 49% inside the three-point arc as a junior (31% 3PT) … Hard-nosed competitor whose activity and effort on both backboards is a constant (5.4 RPG) … Pushes the pace off defensive rebounds and excels in the open floor … Despite considerable “make something out of nothing” playmaking attempts, he rarely gets careless … Superior handles … Lock down defensive potential … Pressures the ball in a low defensive stance, moves very well laterally and his length is disruptive (1 SPG) …","Lack of confidence in his jumper seeps down and infects his greatest strengths … Non-existence of the “in-between game” makes his repertoire a predictable one … Raw shooting mechanics, frequently aborts the follow through … Doesn’t trust his stroke and easily rushed … Scott will bull rush with his head down and attack the rim 9 out of 10 times, even if there’s absolutely nothing there … Defenders play the drive exclusively, goading him to charge into a crowded painted area or step outside of his comfort zone by attempting a pull-up jumper … For all his natural ability with the ball in his hands, he has a tendency to disappear offensively if not the focal point … Awareness is highly questionable, unable to read the play beyond the initial line of defense and penetrates too deep … Difficulty recognizing help side defense- in part due to tunnel vision, not having his head up to see the proceedings unfold … Capable of the flashy pass (2.5 APG), however, doesn’t make teammates around him better on a per game basis … He’s been pinned a ball dominant two-guard rather than a legit lead guard prospect … Could get to the free throw line with greater regularity (where he shoots 77% on 4 attempts per) if he eliminated the acrobatics …",77,203,23.36
Christian Watford,-1,"Quality shooter, Watford shows potential as a stretch forward … Has good size (6’9"") and length (7’0"") for a player with his shooting ability … Drives to the basket with aggression and draws his share of fouls … Deadly catch-and-shoot player … Has the size to play the 4 if necessary, thus spreading the floor and minimizing his flaws in perimeter defense … Good step-back jumper … His length aids him on the defensive end … Possesses a decent face-up game…Solid rebounding small forward … Shot over 48% from deep last year, as well as 81% from the line …","Somewhat one-dimensional, as he doesn’t do any one thing particularly well except shoot spot-up jumpers …Very inefficient inside the arc, as his three-point percentage was significantly higher (48% vs. 43%) than his total field goal percentage last season … Has a very slow shooting motion, as he brings the ball down to his waist before bringing it back up … Much more slow and cumbersome than a typical NBA forward … Poor athleticism limits his offensive repertoire as well as his defensive ability … A bit of a ""tweener"" type of forward, unable to guard either position well … Mostly ineffective on the post-up with poor touch around the rim…Can be a streaky shooter from game to game…Below-average passer and ball handler … Limited potential for growth at 22 years of age … Body language and effort is occasionally questionable …",81,230,22.18
Brandon Triche,-1,"His physical strength is imposing, and his best attribute, helping him on both ends of the floor … Very durable, started every single game during his 4 years at Syracuse … Hard working, his quiet demeanor does not diminish his leadership skills, he leads by example … Bounced back after having a junior season in which pts, rebs, asts all fell from sophomore season, as did his playing time … Started at PG his freshman year, moved off the ball to make way for players like Scoop Jardine and Michael Carter-Williams … Has the ability to play both guard positions at 6’3 … He is an underrated scorer, having the ability to score in a variety of ways, something he has worked extremely hard to develop … Has a ton of big game experience, against top talent both in game as well as practicing against his teammates … Solid in transition and a good finisher … Solid pick and roll skills as ball handler …","Lacks a true position … Sub-par athleticism for an NBA guard … At times he’s not assertive enough, because he has a team first mentality to the point of being too unselfish … Despite being a senior his ISO skills and offensive game are just average. Also not a very efficient spot up shooter … Although his scoring ability is evident, he has the tendency to drift in and out of games. For a freshman this would be understandable, but for a senior who has started every game of his career it is not … Triche is seen as a solid defender but is undersized defending 2s at the next level … Transition from 2-3 to man-to-man could be difficult due to lack of experience, as well as foot speed …",74,210,22.42
Elijah Johnson,-1,"A combo guard with excellent physical tools. His first step is electric, and he covers ground very quickly with top-notch speed and also displays superior strength on the court for a guard … An exceptional leaper. In terms of raw athleticism, he’sat or near the top of the class … Despite being given very little time at the point in Kansas so far, he has displayed capability in being able to distribute the ball well … He’s a very unselfish player, and has good floor vision … Defensively he shows the effort needed to succeed at the next level, and he clearly has the physical tools to excel. Johnson has a long wingspan and a depending on what position he plays at the next level, he could have solid size … He also displays a smooth jump shot, with nice mechanics. When he has the chance to get into the paint, he’s extremely effective there as a finisher …","All of Johnson’s weaknesses seem to stem from the same problem: inconsistency … Defense certainly applies here, as off the ball he tends to lose man fairly easily … It continues with his shot, despite showing great form and actually being a pretty good outside shooter, Johnson had mediocre percentages last season. Along with shot selection, a huge indicator of why he shoots low percentages are the level of difficulty on the shots he takes (over 60% of his shot attempts were 3 pointers). While Johnson isn’t a high level ball-handler, it is downright ridiculous that a player with his athletic capabilities not only takes so many deep balls, but avoids the paint almost completely (1.2 FTA in over 30 mpg) … For such a supremely talented player, it’s disappointing that he is this raw at this stage of his career, especially when factoring that we don’t know whether he will end up being a PG or SG at the next level.",74,195,22.98
Kenny Boynton,-1,"Has the ability to score in bunches and take over games … Great offensive repertoire and can score in variety of ways … Above average speed and athleticism … Solid defender with quickness to stay in front of his man … Was given a big load (responsibility) in his freshman year and responded well … Very coachable player who Billy Donovan speaks highly of … Good all-around game, has the potential to be more than just a scorer … A bigtime competitor with a killer instinct.
