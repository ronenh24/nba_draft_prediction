Anthony Davis,1,"Fluid athleticism, incredible length and guard agility in a 6’10 package … Davis is a game wrecking defensive presence and disruptor unlike any incoming draft prospect in quite some time (4.8 BPG) … He combines the physical shot blocking package of a 7’6 wingspan and quick leaping ability with a relentless motor and high-level defensive intelligence … In addition to his length, the speed at which he chews up ground allows him to affect shots all over the court … He has phenomenal recovery speed and can cover up the defensive blemishes of teammates … Single-handedly suffocates opponents physically and mentally, as they know all attempts within his vicinity will be heavily contested at minimum … Looks like a natural guarding on the perimeter, with quick feet and exceptional hands for a man his size- averages 1.5 steals per game, an unheard of figure at the college center spot … Rarely gets into foul difficulty despite his aggressive, attack every shot nature … Davis uses his freakish gifts on the boards as well, snatching nearly 10 rebounds (3 off.) in 31 minutes of action … Not afraid to mix it up on the interior despite his frail build … Highly efficient offensive weapon (13.8 PPG, 65% FG) … Predominantly an off-the ball target, cleaning up on alley-oops both off the pick and roll and dribble hands offs … Few passes are out of reach, seemingly able to elevate as high as required. RUNS the court … While not necessarily a power finisher, his explosiveness of the deck is effortless … Capable of mid-air body adjustments on errant passes … Displays the body control to hang and alter release to finish through a bump … His jump shot form is aesthetically pleasing (71% FT), and its effectiveness certainly can be cultivated with work and experience … Shows glimpses of pick and pop aptitude … Bullet outlet passes are a major strength … Can handle the ball in space with occasional facilitation of the offense, and does not appear limited to straight line drives … Commits under a turnover per game as a freshman big, highlighting his guard skills … Still only 18 years of age, Davis grew 7 inches (6’3-6’10) between his HS junior and senior seasons … Dynamic versatility at both ends of the floor makes for boundless potential …","The number one drawback on Davis is his overall strength, or lack thereof .. Despite his youth, he is unquestionably thin and the issue remains just how much weight he can add, and how that added weight will affect his speed and agility … His shoulders suggest he can build on his frame, and he’s noticeably chiseled his arms, however a thin waist likely means he won;t be able to bulk up substantially … Must work on his core and lower body- easily gets pinned and backed down in the paint … Unable to establish and maintain position inside, often finding himself bumped off balance … Rarely used in isolation post-up’s during his freshman campaign, particularly given his size advantage on many nights and solid footwork … Offensive canvas is raw, with obvious enormous room for improvement … Doesn’t yet have a feel for his jump shot, often rushing the attempt and shooting a flat shot … There are times where he displays extreme comfort handling the ball, but face-up/dribble-drive maneuvers are few and far between … While he’s a tremendous secondary and tertiary leaper, he too often leaves his feet on pump fakes … It’s hard to fault him for being shot block happy, but the lack of discipline is not to his benefit …  His athleticism and length won’t cover up all shortcomings against super competition … Projecting Davis going forward, there’s not much to dislike … Physical maturity is the only visible hurdle standing in his path to beast mode.",82,222,19.31
Michael Kidd-Gilchrist,2,"MKG is a strong, athletic small forward who possesses the intangibles that can’t be taught … He’s at his best in open space, whether it’s in the half court or transition … While most use separation to rise and fire, MKG uses it to build momentum and fearlessly attack the basket … Excellent finisher at the rim with explosive leaping ability, soft hands and the ability to adjust in mid-air … Tremendous length allows him to effortlessly finish plays with dunks … Also able to absorb and finish after contact … Moves well off the ball terms of angling his cuts as a slasher … Does not need the ball to be effective or impact a game … Though not known for his jumper, showed some promise spotting up when his feet are set … Strong, aggressive rebounder thanks to his relentless pursuit of the ball, non-stop motor and athleticism … Lockdown defensive potential with the versatility to guard to 3-4 different positions … Physical on-ball defender with a high awareness level off the ball … Has a desire, intensity and will to win that elevates his status into elite level despite not having elite skills or potential …","Jack of all trades, master of none … MKG’s biggest weakness surrounds his inability to create his own shot in the half court … Sometimes too intent on getting to the rim when a short pullup is the better play, which he hasn’t consistently shown he has in his arsenal… Lacks range on his jump shot, and won’t be considered a stretch-threat by opposing defenses … Shooting motion has a hitch in it, which will be an issue as he looks to extend his shooting range …  A bit undersized at the next level to get the same easy buckets he got in college … Could use some work as a ball-handler on the perimeter …",79,233,18.77

Dion Waiters,4,"Waiters’ style of play reflects your prototypical combo-guard … At 6’4 with a strong physical foundation, Waiters can play both on and off the ball throughout stretches of a game … He’s a scorer at heart, but his ability to create off the dribble results in open looks for teammates, which Waiters is capable of finding as a passer …  Always looking to get out in transition, he can change directions off the bounce, effectively absorb and deflect contact and finish at the rim … Uses screens well off the dribble, recognizes when to hesitate and accelerate over the top … He’s an above average shooter with NBA range … Comfortable shooting off the dribble inside the arch and via catch and release outside the arch … Athleticism allows him to penetrate the heart of the defense, where he’s illustrated a soft touch on his floater … Defensively he has active hands and quick feet, and is a constant threat to steal the ball when defending a loose/careless handle … Often comes out of nowhere for pokes and swipes as an off-ball defender …","He’s clearly not a point guard, so you wonder how he’ll perform offensively against athletic 6’6 NBA 2-guards … Would see a huge rise in stock if he can learn to facilitate in the halfcourt as a quarterback … Struggles at times creating good shots in the halfcourt … With his athleticism and bounce off the dribble, paired with the ability to explosively elevate, Waiters should attack the rim more often (only attempts 2.5 free throws per game) … Needs to improve as a free throw shooter in general (only 70%) … Playing at the top of the zone, he hasn’t had the experience defending prolific 1s or 2s in isolation…",76,215,20.56

Andre Drummond,9,"Physically gifted, Drummond’s combination of size, power, mobility, athleticism and explosiveness is unparallelled at the college level … Because of these physical tools he’s able to finish with authority on a consistent basis, whether the rim is protected or left open … Can adjust in mid-air at the rim- doesn’t need the perfect pass to finish … Because of his upward explosiveness and size, guards just need to lob the ball around the cylinder and he can go up and get it without a running start… Has a soft overall feel for the rim from about 12 feet out in all directions … Very good at finishing non-dunks around the rim … Active and effective on the offensive glass … Runs the floor really well for his size … Has a quick spin with his back to the basket … Willing and creative passer … Timely shotblocker with sound footwork patrolling the paint … Active shot-contester …","Drummond wasn’t featured on the block that much as a freshman, and his post-game remains raw and unsure … Hasn’t mastered any go-to post moves, as the ones he converts are usually awkward and off-balance … Haven’t really seen a one-handed hook that most big men develop first, and seems to shoot with both hands on the ball all too often … The majority of his points come from the creativity of others, instead making them happen himself … If his playmakers are shut down, it’s possible Drummond will disappear through stretches, or even games … Only attempted 2.6 free throws per game, and shot an appalling 29% from the line… Not much range on jumper with a low release right in front of his face … Maturity issues, level of commitment and the need for vast offensive development could be a cause for concern from GMs not looking to take a chance in the top 3-5 …",83,279,18.9

Jared Sullinger,21,"Highly refined, old school post player in a draft saturated with “potential”. His game is marked by both power and skill. Legitimate low block scorer often working his way into a high quality look (17.5 PPG on 52% FG). Master of positioning at 280 pounds and establishes early. Uses his wide body and derriere to keep defenders locked onto his hip. Tremendous lower body strength pinning his opponents into submission. Aggressively throws his weight around and unafraid to punish those in his path. Thrives on contact. Wide array of post moves on the low block, finishing over either shoulder with either hand. Footwork and understanding of angles are advanced. Soft hands and a feathery touch. Nimble elusivity for his size. He has taken strides in the face-up game, working from the elbow area in space without threat of a double. He’s a dual threat from there, either comfortably popping a mid-range jumper or attacking off the bounce with skilled handle. Quickness is not his ally, but he’s a bull in a china shop. Technically sound jump shot with smooth release. Range has extended to three-point territory, shooting 40% on over 1 attempt per game last season. 77% shooter at the free throw stripe, to which he is a frequent visitor. Strong basketball IQ- reads double teams, finds the open man and rarely get careless with the ball (1.2 AST: 1.9 TO). Excellent anticipation on the glass, clears room with his big frame (9 RPG, 3 Offensive). Intuitive defender with good hands (1.2 steals). Averaged a shade over a block per game last year, a healthy upgrade from 0.5 as a freshman. Added muscle weight and improved conditioning that resulted in more effective minutes at full strength, as well as more explosive movements.","Lacks the overall physical gifts of other top prospects in the draft class. Appears stuck in glue at times, particularly against long, athletic competition. His space-creating advantage and wide base are nullified. No elevation off the floor and severely limited explosion. Plays beneath the rim. Run the courts laboriously. Lateral quickness is poor- badly exposed in space and on pick and roll switches. Undersized for the center position, a shortcoming he does not make up for in length. Major concerns defensively against new breed, mobile NBA 4’s. Not an intimidating presence on the back line of a defense. Less than a blocked shot per game in conference play, and does not alter attempts either. Averaged more steals than blocks. Position defender. He’s overwhelmed by size, length and athleticism on both sides of the ball. The majority of his dominant efforts came against lesser competition and teams devoid of frontline size. His 5/19 performance in his final collegiate game against Kansas did not aid his draft standing. His body style will always be susceptible to weight issues. Can’t afford to rest on his laurels and be satisfied with current level of conditioning and agility if he wants to remain in the lottery.",81,268,20.33

Arnett Moultrie,27,"High-level athlete combo forward with excellent size and length. Versatile offensive skill set to score inside/outside (16.5 PPG). Could be seen as being big enough to play center in today’s NBA. He possesses rare agility at 6’11 in tandem with a hunger for activity and relentless motor. Runs the court like a guard, with a fluid gait and long, easy strides.  Nightmare matchup for opponents on the interior due to explosive quickness and elevation. Extraordinarily nimble and quick mover in the paint. He has added strength and bulk (225 to 240) without losing that calling card explosiveness. Uses his athleticism to earn high percentage looks (58%), elevating above defenders. Displays a deft touch and equally adept at finishing with his left hand. Electric spin moves in the post over either shoulder, preferring to attack baseline. Body control and hang time to make the appropriate in-air adjustments and alter release after a bump or if impeded. 83% free throw shooter on over 5 attempts (65% as sophomore). Rebounds at will on both the offensive and defensive backboards, ranking amongst the nation’s leaders with 10.8 per game. Quick leaper on multiple jumps while still retaining 1st jump lift. Utilizes his length and mobility to rebound out his direct vicinity. Flourished on the perimeter during his time at UTEP, albeit in a more liberal style of play. Comfortable in the mid-range with the ability to step out behind the three-point stripe. He has the potential to be an effective face-up weapon with a quick first step and long frame. Had a tendency to play in a “rushed state” early in his collegiate career, but has found an efficient pace his junior season. Doesn’t force shots and playing within a more defined role for the betterment of the team. He displays legit lateral quickness and foot speed to defend on the perimeter and not look like a fish out of water. Multiple position defensive adaptability. Mentally and physically a different player since arriving in the SEC.","Moultrie seems to have transitioned from a SF to PF this season, sacrificing continued perimeter development in the process. Being that he’s not a true post option, he’ll likely see time at both spots on the next level. He’s caught somewhere in between, which can actually be viewed as a strength and serves to illustrate his versatility. Has shown glimpses of range shooting and ball handling aptitude, but more is required for the NBA small forward position.  As he exhibited at UTEP, the potential to be a dynamic face up player is very much present. It’s that potential alone, despite his raw attributes that once again has scouts drooling over his package of skills. Not the most technically sound of prospects, relying on his massive (on most nights) talent, size and athletic advantage. Plays too quickly at times (2.2 TO) and must harness his energy. Could still stand to add more bulk, be more accepting of contact and get to the FT line more consistently. When he begins a move, thinks score only. Not selfish, but at the same time not a prudent passer when attracting defensive attention. At 6’11 with his length and leaping ability, it is inexplicable that he hasn’t been able to block a shot per game (0.9) in any of his three seasons.

Kris Joseph,51,"Excellent frame and length for the small forward position- measured in with a 6’11 wingspan and 8’7.5 standing reach at the pre-draft combine. Looks the part of an NBA swingman, with well above average physical tools and agility. He bulked up significantly during his four years at Syracuse without adding much extra weight. Primary scoring option on a balanced elite eight team during his senior season (13.4 PPG).  At his best in the slashing game where he can gather momentum without the dribble. Improved strength, body control and right/left hand aptitude allows him to complete plays around the rim. Dramatically improved in the mid-range game knocking down pull jumpers after a few power dribbles. Needs to get his legs underneath the shot and go straight up- not efficient when forced to drift horizontally. Solid base, good elevation. 35% three-point shooter, most of the standstill variety. Accuracy from deep is night and day from two short years ago (22%). Confident dribble/driver with dominant right hand. Long strider. Smooth repertoire with just enough herky jerky to keep opponents off balance. For better or worse, does not step out of his comfort zone on the court. Committed under a turnover per game last season. Length wreaked havoc in 2-3 zone, consistently getting deflections and jumping passing lanes (1.4 SPG). Projects as a versatile defender possessing size, athleticism and lateral quickness.","Despite leading Syracuse in scoring, Joseph rarely showed the willingness, or the skill set, to dominate. Vibe of passivity, satisfied to be another piece in the puzzle. His shot creation with the rock in his hands is limited. 38% of his field goal attempts came from distance, which is hard to fathom given his physical canvas. As a result, his FG efficiency dropped to 42% when asked to carry more of the offensive load. Too many settles. While his ball handling has developed, he stills maintains a high dribble with an extreme favoritism to his right side. When he starts left he either pulls up or spins back right. Picks up his dribble at the first sight of congestion. Off the dribble moves are highly predictable. He seems to tighten up rather than be free-flowing with his movements, serving as a detriment to his first step. Lost some explosion in quickness and leaping departments with added bulk—stiffness. Deliberate jumpshot mechanics. Does not have wrist strength to convert off balance opportunities. Projecting his defense at the next level is exactly that; projection. He sat in a zone for nearly four full seasons, albeit, that zone did have man principles. Never quite fulfilled the promise he displayed during an eye catching sophomore campaign.

Cameron Moore,-1,"Uses his pogo stick-like bounce to corral rebounds at both ends at a surprisingly high rate … Very fast and fluid, excellent in the open floor … Showed a half-hook w/touch around the hoop at the PIT and occasionally flashed an up-and-under during the year … Moves well away from the ball w/ basket cuts … Adequate ballhandler and plays well in transition … Solid outlet passer. Keeps the ball high/converts quickly when wide open down low … Above average athleticism helped him avg. nearly 2.5 blocks/gm last season.","Went 29-95 (.305) from beyond the arc over his final two seasons at UAB and converted only .605% from the charity stripe in his collegiate career on just shy of 300 attempts … Uncertain with the ball after post entries in Portsmouth – needed to make his move in about half the time … Has fallen too deeply in love with his turnaround jumper, which he releases too low … High volume shooter (13 attempts a game last year) with a low shooting % for his position (.483) … A bit of a ball-stopper when catching it at the top of the key in the half-court – does not reverse the ball quickly/fluidly … Still cannot pinpoint his wheelhouse on the offensive end; Moore may best be described as a tweener who’s unable to produce on the block or from the perimeter and thinks his unpolished midrange game is significantly shinier than it really is … Not nearly physical enough down low (averaged less than 2 fouls per contest over his final two collegiate seasons while playing almost 35 mins. a night) …",82,223,21.64
Terrance Henry,-1,"Henry’s ability to cover space and make decisive moves in two dribbles or less in the half-court was on display in Portsmouth and is further backed up on his film … Mixes the pump-fake with slight hesitation moves to freeze defenders when rising up for the jumper … His one-dribble pull-up is textbook and his straight up-and-down form is punctuated by his feet landing in virtually the same spot he takes off from … Henry also utilizes an effective jump-stop after getting defenders on his hip that helps him gather himself before going up against the trees in the middle … More impressive is his combination of length, body control, and touch when attacking the rim off the bounce, which he leaned on throughout the season to overcome solid on-ball defenders in the SEC … Great elevation for a player his size, as well as very fluid/agile … Willing passer that knows which spots to find bigs and when to get them the ball in a possession … Solid FT shooter … Size and quicks to defend both wing spots in the NBA.","Skill level makes him a tweener … Could develop into an NBA small forward, as his foot speed and athleticism and there, but his skill level is still way behind … Never broke out into the player that many envisioned. He has the talent, but his assertiveness and confidnece fluctuate … Added minutes/touches meant added TOs for Henry as a Sr. (3.4/gm in 30.9 mins.) … Tends to leave his feet without a clear idea of where he’s going with the ball on the drive, sometimes leading to errant heaves that have little chance of going in … Hovered right around 4 rebs/gm as a collegian, which is underwhelming at his size … Knocked down a combined 59 3’s in four yrs. at Ole Miss … Not a lazy player, Henry’s one of those guys who makes everything look easy and doesn’t possess a motor that never shuts off … Smooth, maybe too smooth … Not exceptional at anything … Could ultimately be a tease unless he develops more desire and intensity …",82,195,22.71
Josep Franch,-1,"Good height for the position, he’s an underrated athlete … Great leadership and basketball IQ. He has good playmaking skills and natural instincts as a passer … Pushes the ball in transition effectively and attacks the basket with confidence, often finding teammates when the defense collapses on him … Strong defensive work ethic, with good instincts and quick hands. He’s a master of  intangibles … Often has a great influence on games without remarkable stats … Great experience despite young age …","Though crafty, his athleticism is below average by NBA standards… He could suffer defensively due to his lack of lateral quickness … Poor perimeter shooter that limits his offensive effectiveness … His mid-range game is lacking … Needs to bulk up …",75,190,21.43
Ramone Moore,-1,"Great length – wingspan helps him occupy more space defensively than other 6’4” guards … Crashes glass hard on both ends. Fearless when attacking the tin and gets to the line (over 4 attempts per game). Rebounds well for the position … Explosive scorer who can put points on the board from deep, midrange, and getting to the rim/line … Unusually comfortable putting it on the deck with his off-hand … Moore has great instincts off the ball, especially when teammates are penetrating. He catches opponents sleeping often with baseline cuts/hard flashes into the lane … A leader – accustomed to being counted on as a scorer.","Undersized … Looks like he’s a little flat-flooted when guarding the ball – slow reactions vs. guys with explosive first steps … Also has a tendency to size up his opponent with his long arms at his sides for a beat too long when on-ball, negating his length for a brief period … Doesn’t go all-out after live-ball TOs when it appears the opponent’s going to score (not many do, but coaches still want to see it). High volume shooter (14.3 FGA/gm last year) who doesn’t shoot it that well (.426 as a Sr.) … Gives the ball away a little more than you’d like (2.4 TOs/gm), which doesn’t bode well for a guy adjusting to a 24 second shot clock … Finishes with his right hand from the left side too often …",77,188,23.1
Scott Machado,-1,"A pure, pass-first point guard, Machado’s best attribute is his incredible floor vision both in the half court and transition … The game just slows down for Machado, whose excellent anticipation as a passer meshes with his roving peripheral vision … Works the drive and dish game effectively, hitting his shooters in rhythm on the perimeter and cutters in stride through the lane … Good athlete, not great, with a quick first step and a nice burst off the dribble hesitation and over screens … Shows nice touch on finesse shots over the interior line of defense …  Improved his 3pt percentage to 40% as a senior, showing fluent mechanics and a sense of comfort shooting both off the dribble and the catch … Excellent control and decision-making running the break … Shows a strong ability to protect the ball (3-1 a/to ratio) …","Machado is not an overwhelming athlete or speed merchant, which is generally required for most 6’1 average sized point guards … Lacks explosion, which will make finishing around the rim a challenge at the next level … Won’t get you a ton of points as a scorer (only scored over 20 once all season) … He’s vulnerable defending in isolation, which will be an issue against stronger and quicker NBA point guards … Playing in the MAAC, he doesn’t face the level of competition of say a Kendall Marshall or Marquis Teague, which could strike fear in the minds of scouts who will be comparing and evaluating…",74,205,22.07
Tony Mitchell,-1,"High-level athlete with good length for a wing player … Solid size for a small forward, standing about 6’7"" with long arms … Strong frame … Runs the floor well … Explosive leaper … Finishes with authority in transition opportunities … Because of his length and leaping ability he’s an easy alley-oop target for point guards … Quality mid-range shooter, which suggests that he could develop into a better overall shooter eventually … Excellent defender … Uses his length and lateral quickness to keep his man in front of him … Guarded the post well in college … Gets a fair amount of blocks (1.4 per game in 2011-2012) and steals (1.0 per game) … Aggressive rebounder …","Lacks range or versatility with his shooting ability … Doesn’t get to the stripe very much at all, and is not effective when he does (61.5% on 2.4 free-throws attempted per game) … Ball-handling ability is well-below average for a wing player … Has yet to display the ability to create offense for himself off the dribble … No post game to speak of … Can be over-aggressive defensively, leading to foul trouble … Was suspended indefinitely halfway through his junior season for conduct detrimental to the team, leading to questions about his attitude and character …",78,220,22.91
Xavier Gibson,-1,"Possesses ideal size (7’3 wingspan) and fluidity for a bigman … Showed out in Portsmouth with his vocal leadership and passing acumen … The best thing I can say about Gibson at this point is that he knows who he is as a player and does what’s asked of him. He didn’t shoot any 3’s at the event (a dismal 12/48 in his four years at FSU), did not force the issue in the post when nothing presented itself, and even passed up a decent midrange look to get his team a better shot by kicking out to a wide-open shooter … Solid footwork on a face-up jumper from 15’ (reverse pivot) … Understanding of timing/spacing/finding a body on PNR situations was impressive – slipped screens repeatedly in the middle of the floor when defensive rotations were unclear on his way to 19 points on 9/12 shooting in one affair … Established deep position consistently on the blocks.","Has a tantilizing combination of length and athleticism but has never been able to play to his abilities … The numbers don’t lie. For whatever reason, Gibson was unable to string together a season in Tallahassee that approached a double-double (with highs of 6.8 points and 4.3 boards a game, respectively) … Also off-putting about the big fella’s track record is his inability to stay on the floor for meaningful minutes (never more than 18.5 mins./gm) … The strongest part of his game is his understanding of the nuances of the PNR, but his pedestrian (at best) shooting numbers at FSU can only lead scouts/GMs to be apprehensive when projecting what he’ll actually be able to do with the ball once he gets it … Not a high volume rebounder … His soft body, which he’s certainly worked on, still needs a considerable amount of work.",83,266,23.67

Shows great confidence in taking the last second shot, accounting for many late game heroics… True leader really since sophomore year at Xavier … Has massive hands (like Rondo), which allow him to control the ball with great confidence; also allows him to excel as a defender … Despite being primarily a scorer, Holloway has stepped up his point guard abilities with developing passing skills … Very smooth, rarely losing his composure during a game … Solid athlete. Proven to be very efficient in transition","Undersized, combo guard. Likely just 5’11 in shoes … For a player that is known for being a scorer, his jumpshot is unorthodox and lacks a clean release … Relies heavily on his jump shot, often times leading to low percentage fadeaways … Will have trouble getting his jump shot off efficiently, as he does not display ideal height against the top point guards in the NBA … Must learn to take on more of a point guard role rather than a score-first mentality … Does not possess top-tier speed as a point guard, but is able to control the game at his own pace … Although an excellent penetrator, he has difficulty doing so in the half court game; it is only in fastbreak opportunities that we truly see Holloway’s speed and ability to attack the rim … Go to shot is off the dribble, which leads to predictability for those defending him … Three point percentage has gone down over time …",72,187,22.87
Mitchell Watt,-1,"Effortless stroke and shoots with confidence out to 17’ …  Crafty passer, especially from the high-post when looking for cutters … Operates comfortably with his back to the basket when given room to operate – gets defenders off-balance with solid footwork in and around the paint … Effective use of counter-move (up and under) shows opponents’ respect for his right-handed baby hook … Outstanding shot-fake that complements his steady mechanics well; close-out defenders tend to want to leave their feet to block his shot after seeing his methodical routine before rising up … Sneaky around the tin, often drawing contact when he cannot finish (5.0 FTA/gm and .744 from the stripe as a senior) … Tremendous backline defender at the collegiate level … Great communicator, eyes always up, and quick to rotate from the helpside … Will not struggle grasping defensive concepts at the next level (i.e., defensive three-second violation/various ways of defending the PNR) … Exceptional timing on blocks (averaged 2.2 bpg in both junior and senior years).","Deliberate release – needs room to get his shot off when facing up … Only hit 11/34 from distance as a college senior and does not possess NBA range at this point … Tends to finish with his left hand on either side of the rim … Prone to foul trouble … Although he only fouled out twice during the 2011-2012 campaign, Watt racked up at least 4 personals in 11 contests as a senior … If not corrected, his penchant for drawing whistles could hurt a team wanting to play Watt in spot duty late in quarters with automatic free throws being awarded after the 5th team foul at the NBA level …",81,221,22.55
