Cade Cunningham,1,"A prized 6’8 220+ lb lead guard prospect who has the skill set and physical gifts to double as a match up nightmare for smaller guards, while also being able to match up well with the bigger wings and “point forwards” the NBA has to offer … Has shown throughout his amateur career that he has no issue using his size to his advantage, whether its simply by overpowering guards on his forays to the hoop with his strong frame, getting to his spots and rising up above defenders to score, not being shy about mixing it up with front line players in the paint, or being able to see over the top of the defense and creating different angles or make cross court dimes … An unselfish player who can make timely passes on the move, his 3.5 apg as a Fr. doesn’t speak to his willingness or ability as a playmaker … Likes to crash the glass (6.2 rpg) and initiate easy, quick strike offense before the defense can get set after a missed or made shot … Good in transition, defenders generally struggle to contain him when in his path to the rim in the open court and he usually delivers well timed passes to teammates who get to the rim or 3-point line if he doesn’t call his own number … Pretty effective operating in the pick and roll, showing a good command of when to pass the ball and often making pocket passes to moving teammates even against tight hedges and over defenders outstretched hands … A strong isolation player who is at his best when going downhill; effective driving in either direction (seems to prefer going to his left though) and generally does a good job of not getting out of control when operating, and can play above the rim with an opening and a head of steam … Polished. Has an intriguing triple threat repertoire, he frequently frees himself up and gets space in the mid-range area by making subtle head and body fakes going in either direction, and has the size and strength to keep defenders on his hip when he gets a step on them … Takes and converts a good amount of step back and sidestep shots off the dribble, showing good ability to lose defenders and get daylight in the mid-range and from deep … Also shows promise as a finisher given his very good strength and body control, has some hesitation and spin moves he goes to if his initial path to the rim is cut off … Effective floater, especially when going right … Above average instincts and basketball acumen, reads the action well on both ends of the court and also does a good job of dictating the flow of the game with the ball in his hands … Came into college with questions about his shooting, and quieted doubters as the year progressed after converting 40% from deep on a robust 5 attempts a game, and he found a variety of ways to make those shots be it spotting up, in transition, off the bounce and occasionally even coming off pin downs … Groundwork is there for him to be a good post-up player when matched up against smaller guards as well, and he is already reasonably effective utilizing spins and hooks over his left shoulder when the defender sits on his strong hand … Projects to be a very good defensive player at the next level, and will offer plenty of versatility as a guy who can potentially switch PG-PF without much drop-off, which holds massive value in today’s NBA … When focused, Cunningham can smother players on the perimeter guarding the ball, beat screens and get back into the play, and also is an asset as a help defender contesting in the paint and/or stepping in for charges … Additionally, he has already shown signs of quick hands and playmaking on this end (1.6 spg & nearly a block per game as a Fr.)…Up to the task in crunch time and when his team needed a scoring boost in general, wants the ball and came up big with the late-game heroics on more than a couple of occasions for OK State as a Fr. with all the eyes on him, which has to be encouraging for his projection as a potential franchise cornerstone … Shot 84% from the FT line (nearly 6 FTA per game), further quieting doubters about his shooting touch while highlighting his hard work into being a shot-making threat … Would not be a surprise to see Cunningham’s overall efficiency rise in the NBA, where there will be less defensive attention placed solely on collapsing on him and more capable shooting options than he enjoyed in his year in Stillwater … Very precocious, mature and confident individual … High character individual with strong family background …","While he is a physically gifted prospect, Cunningham lacks some of the juice in his legs required to be considered a dynamic athlete or leaper … Not the quickest or fastest player either, and it shows at times when he is attacking the rim and/or trying to turn the corner in the pick and roll game offensively in the half court, leading to a number of offensive fouls or wasted possessions that contributed to his high turnover rate and negative A:TO in 2020-2021 (4 topg to 3.5 apg) … Generally makes good decisions against traps and hard hedges, but sometimes forces passes through multiple defenders and had moments when he airmailed passes under pressure as well … Sometimes telegraphs where he wants to go with the ball or drives aimlessly into no mans lands and leaves his feet to make passes, giving help defenders an extra split second to come up with steals and deflections … Just OK as a finisher in traffic, more of a below the rim type player who is likely to try and use his body to shield the ball and finish around the defense rather than elevating and finishing with authority amongst the trees in half court offense … Smaller guards can get low and pester him into turnovers when he gets lax with his handle initiating offense, will need to get somewhat more refined and aware as a ball-handler at the lead guard spot … Can be beat off the dribble by slashers occasionally, possesses only adequate lateral quickness and sometimes gets upright when denying penetration; subsequently picking up fouls (2.5 per game) or collapsing the team’s defense … His footwork could stand to improve at times as well, occasionally makes wild closeouts or takes wasted steps that can be attacked off the bounce or turned into FTs by players who are savvy about drawing fouls …",80,220,19.85
Jalen Green,2,"Green is a high upside prospect with elite athleticism and intriguing shooting and scoring ability … he is a fluid and natural scorer, with a wide arrange of ways to score … Can confidently knock down shots from all three levels of the court … One of his best assets is his incredible athleticism and leaping ability … The former consensus five-star recruit finished plenty of alley-oops, dunks, and difficult layups due to his high-flying ability … Green’s hops should translate to easy transition buckets … He also scored with good efficiency, hitting over 46% of his field goals and 36% of his three-point attempts…Despite his young age, Green plays with great maturity, and shows solid understanding of when to hunt his own shot versus look to pass  … Has a variety of moves to attack the basket, and has the speed and quickness to blow past defenders … Is extremely comfortable finishing through traffic … He is an excellent free throw shooter, adding even more hope that he can become a dominant threat from behind the perimeter to add to his inside game … He is an active and engaged defender, and averaged 1.5 steals per game … His long arms, quick reflexes and attention to detail should continue to bolster his case as an above average defender in the NBA … Those steals often led to immediate transition throw downs, a specialty of Green through his 15 games in the G League … While averaging less than three assists per game, Green has enough passing ability at the shooting guard spot to run an offense in spurts at the next level … He can run the pick and roll effectively, in part because he is comfortable throwing accurate, well-timed passes to his running big man … Green does everything you would like out of a NBA shooting guard: knocks down shots, can attack the rim, and set up teammates when needed, while blending in some insane dunks, and athletic ability … Should quickly be a 18-20 point per game scorer, and could lead a team in points per game as a rookie … Went from playing in high school to the G league, and was still one of the league’s best players despite a younger age and significantly less experience than many other players … Has immense potential to be a star at the next level. Quite possibly the player with the highest ceiling in this year’s draft …","Green is a good shooter, but is not yet a sniper from beyond the arc … Is still very skinny, and could use some bulk to his frame in order to be an effective defender and finisher against bigger guards and forwards … Averaged just .1 fewer turnovers than assists, as he sometimes had his pocket picked or made sloppy passing decisions … Would struggle to be a lead guard for longer stretches … Is an average rebounder with over four per game, but does not attack the boards well at this point for a player of his size … Green at times leans on his athleticism around the rim, and can either make finishes more difficult, or make the wrong decision assuming he can outclass his opponent and get to the rim … Has some maturity question marks, but seemed to mature in the past year taking his development year seriously and improving while playing for the Ignite in the G-League … He certainly has all the talent you could ask for but learning to put the team over individual accolades and be a player a team can build a winning culture around is the key …",77,180,19.48
Evan Mobley,3,"Mobley has a chance to be a generational bigman at 7’0, 215 pounds and a 7’4 wingspan … Huge potential as a two-way talent with elite defensive ability to both lock down smaller players on switches on the perimeter as well as his natural rim-protection ability with long arms and tremendous leaping ability … Shuffles his feet with the best of them to stay in front of his man in face ups and post-ups … Run jump athleticism puts him in rare company. Runs the floor like a deer, and has explosive leaping for first as well as second and third jumps … Phenomenal rebounder with his length and size. Also positions himself well for rebounds and does not rely solely on his size to dominate the glass … Versatile offensive player who can already attack from the perimeter and additionally score at all three levels … Jumper already looks smooth and he has the touch to catch and release from many areas … Showcases several post moves and a soft hook shots as part of his scoring repertoire … Already a good passer with anticipation and accuracy and also comfortable facing double teams … Affects the game in a multitude of ways on both ends. Versatility on defense and athletic enough to be disruptive with guards on switches …  Decent ball-handler with plenty of time to improve … Will be 20 years and 1 month old on draft day, making him one of the younger draft prospects … 58/30/69 splits are incredible for a freshman stretch-five at the college level with high volume … Capable screener who can attack on the roll and also set up on the perimeter for open threes …Unmatched potential in this year’s draft class, with his size, athleticism, two-way ability, and shooting prowess …","The biggest hurdle for Evan Mobley is himself. He can be as good as he wants to be, but the big question is, how badly does he want to be great? He looks like AD 2.0 at times, but his body language and energy level raises concerns for some …  His lack of bulk is the main cause for concern in terms of physical attributes … He is just 215 lbs and could use another 20-25 lbs to really bang in the post and not get overpowered by NBA bigs around the basket …  Added weight would likely open up a world of opportunities for Evan as he could become the bully instead of the bullied … Mobley plays a finesse game, and with the way the NBA game has headed, he’s going to find a level of success no matter what, but having strength to absorb contact and draw fouls on a more regular basis would enhance his skill set … Should learn to enjoy contact a little more than he does currently, which again added strength would assist with … Can become anxious defensively and fall for pump fakes too easily … Needs to show more patience and better timing on jumps for blocks and rebounds … He’s likely to struggle holding position in the post or backing down defenders until he bulks up … Has a lot of promise as a ball-handler but polishing this aspect of his game, like Joel Embiid has, will allow the offense to run through him more easily as well as adding another dimension to his pick and pop, isolation game against other centers … Yet to add a reliable post fadeaway to his repertoire, which could make his post-game even more dominant … Most of his weaknesses are just additional elements that would put his game over the top to an elite level, which isn’t a bad problem to have in a prospect … Very soft spoken. Should work on becoming a most vocal leader.",84,215,20.13
Scottie Barnes,4,"Versatility and power are the two greatest strengths of Barnes … He stands at 6’9 and attacks the rim with strength and speed like few others can at his size. He is also listed at 227 pounds, so he does not get pushed off his path very easily … He handles the ball well and can run the point as well as post up down low against bigger defenders … great passer for a combo forward … His versatility on offense is consistent with his versatility on the other end … Barnes has the lateral quickness and strength to guard every position on the court and is able to take the ball away with over two steals per 40 minutes … Plays with great energy on both ends fo the floor … He is a modern era point forward who sees the floor well and elevates above traditional big men with his size, length, and explosiveness … His 2.05 AST/TO ratio is third in the nation among power-five freshman and showcases his poise well beyond his years … He plays with a high motor in his limited minutes as he showed during his takeover against Florida at the end of the first half … Efficient scorer inside of the three-point line at 56% … Tremendous physique with toned arms and legs. has the look of an NBA player at 19 … Freakish 7’2 wingspan with big hands that help him guard any player on the floor … Can impact or take over the game on both ends of the floor, which will allow him to get valuable minutes early in his career and develop his jump shot … High-riser and electric player who can provide a spark at any time … His explosive first step allows him to get around defenders with ease and his strength allows him to maintain this extra step and get to the tin at will … He attacks the basket with both hands and can kick it out with both as well … High ceiling and top shelf potential","The biggest thing holding Barnes back from a higher selection is his inconsistent jump shooting … The willingness to shoot threes is a positive, but his 30% is less than ideal … He is showing that he is more than capable of developing this shot, but inefficiency will hold him back until his perimeter game is a true threat … Not an elite athlete. Lacks great speed in the open floor. Not the most explosive and fluid of athletes, but solid … He does not have the elite ball-handling of the best point-forwards in the NBA or great three-point shooting to make up for it, but he has the tools to expand on these as he has no true faults that cannot be developed … Poor free throw shooting is not a great sign for the development of a consistent jumper as he is shooting just over 50% from the line …",80,225,20.01
Jalen Suggs,5,"Lead guard with great leadership, toughness and physical attributes to be a stand out on both ends at the next level … With his insane athleticism, Suggs can turn any miss into a coast-to-coast layup … He has great feel for when to attack the basket, and a strong mix of dribble moves allows him to blow past defenders … Very decisive in the open court, and has the ability to outclass many opponents with his quickness and elusiveness  but can also bully his way for easy baskets … Understands when to shoot and when to move the ball to a teammate … Tremendous shot selection with regard to the modern NBA, as almost 85% of his attempts came at the rim or behind the arc … Rarely takes mid-range shots, in part because he can so easily get to the rim … Solid finisher, with a field goal percentage of 64% around the rim … Scored 14.4 points per game, but could increase that if allowed to take over in more games, as the offense was often run through Timme … Averaged 5.6 rebounds per game, and fights well for boards … Boxes out well…His tremendous build and 6’4 height bring versatility on both ends of the court … Great versatility. While more comfortable running the offense, Suggs is capable of playing shooting guard, especially with how well he can move without the basketball and would figure to pair well with an undersized off guard … Defensively, he can play either guard spot, as his length, quickness and strength help him take on larger players … Reads the game at an elite level on both offense and defense … Particularly as a help defender, Suggs excels at understanding what the offense is running, and where to position himself in order to limit the chance of an easy bucket … Smart and decisive on when to double, help or go for steals, and is rarely caught making the wrong play defensively … Also excellent at forcing turnovers, averaging 1.9 steals per game…Is one of the most clutch players in college basketball, most notably draining a buzzer-beating three just steps past half court to defeat UCLA in the Final Four … The former five-star recruit also led the team in assists with 4.5 per game, showcasing his willingness and ability to share the ball …","The most glaring weakness for the star freshman is his inconsistency shooting from behind the arc and at the free throw line … Shot just 33.7% from three and 76.1% from the charity stripe … While not impossible to see him becoming a reliable shooter, he has some work to do in order to become more capable, especially as shooting has become gold in the NBA … While smart defensively, Suggs can sometimes lose focus on the ball, and get beat by simple moves, like change of pace toward the basket … Because of his immense talent, it is easy to forget that Suggs was a freshman, but that certainly was exemplified by his turnovers … At almost three per game, that number needs to come down in order for him to be a truly efficient point guard …Playing at Gonazaga, Suggs played a weaker conference schedule than other top prospects… It is not his fault his team was almost always significantly more talented, but Suggs and Gonzaga were rarely challenged throughout the season … They played numerous games against top-25 teams, suffering a loss only to Baylor in the championship game, but the West Coast Conference was simply too easy for the Zags, and for Suggs … It will be a huge jump in competition for Suggs, with what was mostly an easy schedule in college …",76,205,20.17
Josh Giddey,6,"Natural talented point guard with great size … Great feel for the game … Very high basketball I.Q … The kind of player that makes his teammates better … All around player, can do a little bit of everything on the floor and fill up the stat sheet … A triple-double threat when he enters the court … Has showed great potential as a lead guard playing as a teenager in a high level league … An elite passer … Has great court vision, can see angles and passes that few players can … At his best when he is running the break … Can pass over his defender thanks to his size … Almost always in control, rarely rushes his decisions … A Pick and Roll maestro thanks to his size and court vision … Can either find the rolling big, a 3rd man on the weakside, or a cutter from the baseline after he takes a pick … Plays the game at his own pace … He can attack the basket and finish with solid efficiency at the rim, and is a creative finisher … Ambidextrous, can finish plays at the rim with either hand … Has a nice, dependable floater in his arsenal when he attacks the basket… Has shown some promise as a Spot Up shooter … Smart defender… Knows how to take advantage of his size and length on defense… Very good at covering the passing lanes and making steals…","Average athlete… Has a really thin frame, and needs to bulk up considerably … Lacks an elite burst on his first step … Not a great leaper … He might have problems creating separation at the next level because of his athletic limitations and be dependent upon screens to create shots, or make plays for his teammates … Has a slow shooting release and he also has the tendency to lean forward on Spot Up situations … Inconsistent shooter, can be called a streaky shooter at best for now in Spot Up situations … His percentage from the free throw line is worrisome (around 70%), but he is still young … Pull Up game isn’t there yet, he will have to add this to his game to become a bigger threat … A simple “under” coverage in Pick and Roll situations can limit him for now on offense despite his basketball I.Q and size … Has the tendency to become too passive on offense and unselfish to a fault some times … His lateral quickness is average and he doesn’t always have a good low stance on defense, which creates problems when guarding quick point guards … Depends too much on his length and instincts on defense… He might be best suited to guard wings than point guards, but he doesn’t have the build to do that yet.",80,205,18.81
Jonathan Kuminga,7,"Listed at 6’7 and 220 pounds, Kuminga is a physical force on both ends of the court … Freakish athlete with explosiveness, strength and great body control … He also has a solid skill set with the ability to handle and pass the ball … His forte appears to be on the less glamorous (defensive) end, where his quickness, strength and height can disrupt opposing wings and forwards … Kuminga has the build, speed and drive to defend positions 1-4 in the NBA … He can be used to limit a team’s primary scoring option, or as a versatile piece while switching during screens and other plays … While not a turnover forcing machine with just one steal per game, Kuminga should immediately become one of the better, more adaptable and skilled defenders in the NBA … His offensive game has similar intrigue, as he has a great handle for a player his size, and is adept at creating his own shot off of the dribble … The Elizabeth, New Jersey, native excels at driving to the rack, and can finish well in the paint, even when the defense collapses … Likes to work in the post, and can score easily especially against mismatches … Has a well-rounded offensive game, as he can knock down jumpers, penetrate and is a solid passer for his position…Is an elite transition player as well, because he has tremendous speed for his size, and out hustles other players, often leading to easy dunks … Solid scorer and rebounder, at 15.8 points and 7.2 rebounds per contest … Tremendous athleticism should raise both his floor and ceiling, and can help contribute to a greater offensive output until when/if his shooting ability develops … Is one of the youngest prospects in the draft, and is already competing at a high-level against very talented competition, and with an NBA ready body …","Lacks consistency shooting … Kuminga is an incredibly talented player, and one with loads of potential, but the skill that will likely make-or-break him reaching that potential is how much he can improve upon his shooting consistency and range … He averaged just 24.6% from deep, and 62.5% from the foul line … Those numbers simply won’t cut it at the next level, and will severely limit Kuminga’s minutes and impact … Until he bumps those up, he may have to play more as a power forward, even if his best fit is at the small forward position … Lacked moves in the post, and often used the same spin move every time he got on the block … Kuminga needs more diversity in his post moves if he wants to score against bigger, stronger defenders … Can make difficult finishes, but sometimes botches easy ones … He needs to spend time developing his offensive game, as it is clear that checks every athletic and size box, but can look overwhelmed at times during games on offense … Turned the ball over as much as he assisted, and while he can make excellent passes, Kuminga also struggled with decision making …",79,220,18.82
Franz Wagner,8,"Wagner has ideal size and versatility for a modern forward …  At 6’9 and 220 pounds, he will most likely play small forward, but can be comfortable at shooting guard or power forward on offense and defense … His versatility gives him added intrigue … Is a solid rebounder, securing 6.5 boards per game, though added strength will allow him to be stronger on the boards … Boxes out well, and is physical in keeping opposing players away from the offensive glass … Is a tremendous finisher inside, shooting over 70% at the rim … Has a good handle for a forward, and often brought the ball up for the Wolverines … He won’t be the primary ball handler for an offense, but can be a solid secondary offensive initiator as he has great vision … Averaged three assists per game this season, up from just 1 a game in his freshman season … The game is slowing down, and Wagner was able to make better and more decisive reads while the ball was in his hands…Averaged just 1.3 turnovers per game … Shooters free throws at over 83%, highlighting better shooting percentages from three in the future…Clearly has potential on the offensive end, improving in nearly every statistical category this season … For all his ability on offense, his NBA value lies in his defensive range and ability … He can easily guard 2-4 in the NBA, and could guard a point guard or center in a pinch … His defensive versatility matches perfectly with the evolving pro game, as switching on screens and defending multiple positions is becoming a key to defensive success … Long, with active hands, Wagner reads the game well and can disrupt opposing offenses … Is tough to get around, as he has a strong frame and move well laterally … He has excellent understanding of defensive positioning, as he often rotates to take away passing lanes, before recovering well to his man…His IQ and length allow him to contest shots really well … Shooting form looks solid … Despite struggling shooting the ball from the floor, he hit 83% from the line as a sophomore giving his jump shot intrigue to develop …","Wagner may struggle to create his own shot in the NBA due to his lack of explosiveness getting to the hoop and lack of great foot speed to gain separation  … Was an excellent finisher in college, but with much better athletes in the NBA, he may have difficulty matching that success rate … He shot just 34% from deep this season … His inability to shoot from range was disappointing and this could limit his time on the court early in his career … Shot just under 38% on two point jumpers this season, reinforcing that he will not be much of a shooter, at least without years of development … Was only assisted on 7.7% of his two-point jumpers, and can get baited into shooting jumpers rather than getting to the lane … Averaged 12.5 points per game this season, with only six games that he recorded at least 20 points, showing he will be a limited offensive threat … Needs to bring his skill set up to the level of producing excellent defense to increase his value to teams … May struggle to create his own shot, although he should have more space to work with as teams will not be keying their defenses on him as they did at Michigan … For his length and size, Wagner struggled to bring in offensive rebounds, with just 20 in 28 games….

Tre Mann,18,"Skilled combo guard with scoring ability … Possesses a good change of pace that he uses to get defenders off balance. Is able to make a move, keep his dribble, and then capitalize once his defender makes a mistake. Rarely allows defenders to dictate his pace. Uses a good mix of head fakes and ball handling moves to manipulate defenders. Routinely extends plays by continuing to attack defenders to force help side rotations, allowing for his teammates to find openings. Excellent at step back jumpers, especially off the pick and roll – creates a lot of space on his step backs. If defenders stay with his step back, he’s often able to drive to the rim and finish. Always has his eyes up when driving, allowing him to find cutting teammates for easy baskets when the defense helps. Mixes long strides and short choppy steps to create angles to attack. Shoots layups and runners from multiple angles and release points, making it difficult for shot blockers to anticipate his timing. Showed major improvement as a sophomore in getting to the free throw line and shooting a much improved percentage. Only scored in single digits 4 times his sophomore year","Not the explosive athlete you’d hope for at 6’4”. Lacks length with just a 6’4 wingspan …  Has a thin frame that needs to put on muscle at the next level. Passes aren’t always the most accurate – passes don’t always hit teammates in the shooting pocket. This can force teammates to take more difficult shots from time to time. Has a narrow base on his jump shots which projects better for shooting off the bounce as opposed to catch and shoot. Narrow shot base can make it easier for him to be off balance while elevating on his shot. Doesn’t get ideal elevation on his shot, which can lead to easier contests. Can try to do too much, resulting in turnovers. Over-dribbles when met with pressure. Showed a poor second effort at times defensively. Florida’s defense liked to switch 1-4 on ball screens, Mann will have to get used to fighting through/around screens more often.

He struggled to show it at Auburn, but teams have to be considering what he can become if he can add strength and become better at playing through contact … His shooting potential, length and agility are extremely intriguing …","Has one of the most impressive highlight reels of any player, but had a tendency to disappear for long stretches … Has a pretty raw offensive skill set as a player, and he needs to improve his overall fundamentals to become a consistent contributor at the NBA level … For now the game looks too fast for him at times, and he can be slow to react to plays … has a lot of potential, but a team drafting him will need to be patient as he’s clearly a long term project … Has rudimentary ball skills at the moment, with a high, somewhat predictable dribble that SEC defenders often exploited when Thor tried to break them down off the dribble … Becomes more turnover prone with each dribble he takes in half court offense at the current stage, tends to make some head scratching decisions with the ball when he’s forced to make plays on the fly…Had trouble in multiple games making inbounds passes, reacting to live ball pressure/traps, and made a number of very risky cross court passes that led to ugly turnovers, at times showing total concentration lapses that just won’t fly in the pros … Needs to improve his footwork significantly to become a more consistent shooter, often changes his shooting base from shot to shot and seemingly rushes his mechanics when defenders contest which led to middling results (44% FG, 30% 3FG) … Only made multiple 3 point shots in 4 out of 27 games as a Fr … Though he has a high release on his shot, he also some hitches in his shot mechanics, including his habit of dipping the ball to his waist before he gets to his shooting motion, which will buy athletic, savvy pro defenders extra time to contest or even get a hand on the ball before he shoots. He also has a tendency to allow his body to twist too farto the left into  into his shooting motion … Lacks overall strength and girth at the moment as a 205 lb PF/C, really struggled to play through any type of contact as a Fr. on either end of the court if he couldn’t use his length to his advantage…Not much of a low post scorer as a frontcourt player, mostly prefers to face up offensively…Sometimes bails out the defense and makes himself easy to guard by settling for jump shots…Average rebounding production for someone with his physical traits and motor in his lone college season …",82,205,18.94

He averages well over a steal per 40 minutes and plays physical defense at 6’5, 213 pounds … Excellent free-throw shooter at 82% in his senior season … Maintained a starting role in his final three seasons despite an ever-changing lineup utilized by Coach Hamilton … Has become a much smarter defender reducing his fouls per 40 minutes drastically each season … Attacks the glass and is willing to share the ball with his teammates with nearly three rebounds and assists per game … His huge improvement in jump shooting has him climbing up draft boards to be an instant impact 3-and-D player … Has the lateral quickness and strength to defend all kinds of guards and keep them in front of him. He is a defender first, but the shooting improvement is a big step for Walker and will allow him to get chances at the next level …","Walker is one of the oldest players in the draft as he will be turning 23 before the draft comes around … He can play as a point guard but does not create well enough on his own to continue that role consistently at the next level … While he can still play in the role as a shooting guard, he does not have elite size or length … Even as a veteran, Walker is still a little loose with the ball and even averages more turnovers than assists in his final season and in his career as a whole … If he continues to turn the ball over like he has in college, his value will be diminished, and he will not have the time to develop as quickly as he needs to as he is already 23 … Less reliance on ball-handling as a shooting guard should eliminate these turnovers …",77,215,23.35

Must add counter moves when he is posting up… Very left handed dominant, makes him predictable… Despite his solid shooting mechanics, he is a bad 3-point shooter and an average free throw shooter… Has been used as a small forward, but he doesn’t have the offensive skillset to play on the perimeter… At times he is passive on offense, doesn’t look to have the confindece to take over… Doesn’t always sets steady screens, he acts too fast… Average passer… Turnover prone… Can lose focus on defense and mess with defensive rotations… Bigger opponents can post him up …",81,190,19.84
